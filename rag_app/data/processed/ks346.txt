The True Yagya

Rage has no ears, nor does it have vision.

It only leads to reaction.

And reaction leads to regret.

Regret causes frustration.

Frustration clouds the reason.

Unreasonable acts provoke rage, and start a vicious cycle.

Self Knowledge and Devotion alone can free you from this vicious cycle.

In the fire of Knowledge, when rage and revenge are offered, the warmth of the blemishless Self shines forth.

This is the true Yagya.

News Flash:

Guruji was exceptionally busy this week, meeting various leaders of the Muslim and Hindu communities late into the night to bring peace and harmony and a resolution of the Ayodhya issue. He convinced both the Muslim personal law board and the VHP to come on to the negotiating table.

There were remarkably interesting sessions on the AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) symposium on the Science of Breath, some of which Guruji Himself chaired. An international team of doctors presented their research findings to more than 1000 delegates. Synopsis and videos will be made available by May.

Guruji also went to an impromptu Satsang which was organized for Him at Tihar Jail. More than 4000 inmates who had already done the Prison SMART program greeted Him enthusiastically and He went among them and showered flowers of Grace on them.

He noticed that there were some very old women prisoners there, who could barely sit or stand by themselves, utterly incapable of committing any crimes, and He has made an appeal to the Governor to grant them amnesty.

He is now in Rishikesh â€¦..

Jai Gurudev !
