WHAT YOU KNOW

 What shall we talk about today?

 What is the point in talking about something of which you know nothing. And so . . . there is no point in talking about what you know and no point in talking about what you don't know!

 (Laughter)

 Stefano says, "What about something you think you know but don't know?"

 Guruji says, "We can talk about something you think you know but you don't know or something you think you don't know but you know." (Laughter)

 There is no end to learning but there is an end to unlearning. That is when you become totally hollow and empty.

 Riddle:

 What is that something so precious, that you lose it somewhere and find it somewhere else?

 NEWS FLASH

 On the way back from Holland to the German Ashram we had a picnic on the banks of the river Rhine near beautiful Boppard.

 The Ashram was filled to its capacity. Teacher Training Phase 1 and 2 and the advanced course were in full swing.

 Our spring water has a mind of its own. It flows for some people when they go near it and stops for others. Whenever Kirpal went with Guruji's jug, the water joyfully rushed forth!

Jai Guru Dev
