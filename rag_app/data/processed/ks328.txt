Aishwarya and Madhury


In the world, usually where there is Aishwarya (Lordship), there is no Madhurya (Sweetness) and where there is Madhurya, there is no Aishwarya.

Where life has blossomed fully, there is both Aishwarya and Madhurya.

Aishwarya means Ishwaratva – Lordship of that which IS. Wealth, too, is referred to as Aishwarya because wealth does command a certain amount of authority.

Can love and authority co-exist?

Only in a fully blossomed Being, there is both Lordship and Sweetness.

There was Aishwarya in Sri Rama, but only glimpses of Madhurya.

Parshuram’s life shows only Lordship, but no Madhurya.

Buddha manifested more of Madhurya – the sweetness, and less of authority.

But Krishna manifested both Aishwarya and Madhurya. So did Jesus.

There is Lordship when they said, "I am the way!"

And there is Sweetness in their expression of Prayer and Love.

News Flash:

The Art of Living is the only non-profit organization which has been requested to be a part of AMERICA BACK ON TRACK (a train which is going from Washington to New York, and then on to 20 other cities, as a way of encouraging Americans to return to normal).

Courses have started at Uruguay, South America.

The South-East teacher’s meet ended in immense gratitude and heightened fervour!

The Ashram is buzzing with the enthusiasm of more than 200 TTC participants!
