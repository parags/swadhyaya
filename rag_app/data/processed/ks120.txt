The Five Signs Of Satguru

In the presence of Satguru:

1. Knowledge flourishes

2. Sorrow diminishes

3. Without any reason, joy wells up

4. Lack diminishes; abundance dawns

5. All talents manifest

To the degree you feel connected to the Guru, these qualities manifest in your life.

Sit with your eyes closed, feel the connection with the Guru, and start making your own knowledge sheet.

Next week's knowledge sheet will be written and spoken by those whose name starts with the letter "A" and this will continue in alphabetical order.

So,

1. Make a knowledge sheet

2. Take a commitment for a seva project.

The more you give, the more strength will be given to you.

Exercise: Sit with your eyes closed for one minute and surrender your name. How do you feel . . . ?

Dissolving the name is awareness.

Dissolving the form is meditation.

World is name and form.

Bliss transcends name and form.

 

NEWS FLASH

The ashram is being visited by renowned saints from all over the country. After a series of Advanced Courses that ended in tears of joy this week, it is a brief respite for the Ashram volunteers. Guruji was a guest of honor at a gathering of over 15,000 people at the Adi Chunchinagiri Ashram. Preparations are on for Navarathri (nine days of the Mother Divine).

Jai Guru Dev
