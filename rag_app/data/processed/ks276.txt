ARE YOU A TOURIST OR A PILGRIM?

What is the difference between a tourist and a pilgrim?

Both are on a journey.  Whereas a tourist is satisfying the senses, a pilgrim is in the quest of the truth. A tourist gets tired and tanned, while a pilgrim sparkles with spirit. Every move a pilgrim makes is with sacredness and gratitude, while a tourist is often preoccupied and unaware.

A tourist compares with other experiences and places and hence is not in the present moment. But a pilgrim has a sense of sacredness, so he tends to be in the present moment.

Most people in life are just tourists without even being aware of it. Only a few make their life a pilgrimage. Tourists come, look around, take pictures in their mind, only to come back again. Pilgrims are at home everywhere and are hollow and empty. 

When you consider life as sacred, nature waits on you.

Are you a tourist or a pilgrim?

 

NEWS FLASH

Diwali was celebrated in the Ashram. With the festival of lights setting in, fifty people got back their sight, while thousands got insights. Guruji told the meaning of Amma's name "Visalakshi" as "one with broad vision" on the First anniversary of Amma's MahaSamadhi.  "Broad vision gives you the Guru and in turn Guru gives you the broader vision."

Guruji was a State Guest in Orissa where he arrived after a brief Satsang in Chennai. Guruji went to Jagannath Puri, the Eastern seat of wisdom, where Vishnu Yagna was performed. Puri had a great satsang, where many people reported miraculous healing experiences. Report from Argentina tells us about the stunning experience of the medical team on the miraculous

disappearance of a malignant tumor where the patient was given 48 hours to live.

Though it was the first time in Orissa, the arrangements and the enthusiasm were simply unmatchable as Guruji mesmerized a crowd of more than 35,000 people.

 

Jai Guru Dev
