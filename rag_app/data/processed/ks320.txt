YOU AND OWNERSHIP

Man has a tendency to own things. When he owns something small his mind stays small, his life gets stifled and his whole consciousness is immersed in his house, car, spouse, children and such. A recluse leaves his home and goes far away. There also he starts owning his asana, rosary, books, concepts and his knowledge.

The owning has simply shifted from objects and people to ideas and practices. But a wise one knows that he owns the sun, the moon, the stars, the air, all of space and the Divine in its entirety. When you own something big then your consciousness also expands, and when you own something small then all the small negative emotions start coming up such as anger, greed, etc.

I wonder why people do not feel connected to the sun? The very existence of life depends upon the sun. Perhaps it is the lack of awareness that one refuses to acknowledge and own one’s connectedness to the macro-cosmic universe. The Rishis in ancient India, the Native Americans and the aboriginals from all over the globe have insisted that you can feel connection to the sun, moon and the directions.

When you own something magnanimous your consciousness also becomes magnanimous.
