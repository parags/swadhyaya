KNOWLEDGE AS A BURDEN

Knowledge is a burden if it robs you of innocence.
Knowledge is a burden if it is not integrated into life.
Knowledge is a burden if it doesn't bring joy.
Knowledge is a burden if it gives you an idea that you are wise.
Knowledge is a burden if it doesn't set you free.
Knowledge is a burden if it makes you feel you are special.

 

NEWS FLASH

We are used to all kinds of systems -- financial systems, operational systems, management systems, social systems But we are oblivious to the Cosmic System that has always been prevalent.

Transition from our little systems of functioning to the cosmic system of functioning is what we call Chaos. The little mind blasts into the Cosmic System around Sri Sri, giving out laughter, pain, tears, gratitude and other emotions. All our ashrams run on the cosmic system, and the devotees' homes are also switching to this mode of functioning.

Sri Sri's return to India saw the three-thousand strong crowd at the Bombay satsang, (amazing for a weekday afternoon, with virtually no publicity!) in a frenzy of joyous celebration. From masti in Mumbai, it is now bliss in Bangalore!

Jai Guru Dev
