EGO IS ONLY AN ATOM

The "I" or ego in you is a tiny atom. If this atom is put with the body, the matter, it identifies with the matter. If this atom is put with the Being, the Infinite, it identifies with the Infinite.

When this atom, this ego, is associated with the material world, it becomes mundane. When it is associated with the spirit, it becomes Divine. It becomes shakti when associated with the Being, the Self. It becomes miserable when identified with the body.

You see, in a huge atomic reactor, it is just one tiny atom that is exploded. In the same way, in our whole body, there is just one little tiny atom of "I". And when this "I" explodes, that is when it becomes the light of the Self.

Usually we say, "I am miserable, " or "I am happy".

Shift this atom from identifying with the body and the conceptual world, to identifying with the Real World.



NEWSFLASH !

Ottawa, Canada's capital, was graced with the Master's presence for two action-packed days this past week, where his public talk on Human Values at the elegant Chateau Laurier made the TV evening news, and the Hindu Temple experienced a tidal wave of joy and bliss. Then our caravan moved on to the advanced course at the Montreal Ashram, where we set new attendance records with 450 course participants. All are amazed at how smoothly things have gone, and there is no question that this is all due to the Guru's grace. A group of devotees from Central America has everyone dancing at the lively satsangs this week in our spacious and colourful tent by the lake. Nature has cooperated by providing perfect weather all week, and no bugs! Everyone is happy amidst great celebration. Fireworks at the lake on Thursday night will mark the grand finale of the North American summer tour, as Guruji prepares to leave for Germany.
