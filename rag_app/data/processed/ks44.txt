 If you say that you have no one in this world, then you are disowning me. And if you disown me then I cannot do anything for you.

 What is Vivek? Vivek means knowing that everything is changing. Time and again you have to awaken to this -- that the world, the people, our body, our emotions, are constantly changing.

 When you experience sorrow, understand that Vivek has been overshadowed.
