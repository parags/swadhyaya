SPRITUALITY AND CELEBRATION

Celebration is the nature of the spirit.
Any celebration has to be spiritual.
A celebration without spirituality does not have any depth.
And silence gives the depth to celebration.
Some people think being silent is spirituality.
E.g. Many meditators feel that laughing, singing and dancing are not spiritual.

Some people think only celebration is spirituality.
E.g. In some parts of the world, such as in rural India or Africa, celebration means loud music; there is no silence at all.

Spirituality is a harmonious blend of outer silence and inner celebration ; and also inner silence and other celebration!

NEWS FLASH

His Holiness the Dalai Lama was in Bangalore and met Guruji. He was all praise for the Art of Living programs in building India and the world. He lauded Guruji for his success in reviving the ancient Indian Vedic heritage and presenting it to the world in such an accessible way in a modern context.

At the recent International Youth meet on Human Values organised by the United Nations in Seoul, South Koreo, the Art of Living Foundation played a stellar role, and out of the nearly 1000 NGOs participating, Art of Living was the only workshop to be mentioned in the closing ceremony.

Navratri celebrations at the Ashram were a combination of bubbling joy, deep meditation and profound silence. Among the many saints who graced the occasion were the Shankaracharya, and Swami Swatantranand with his humour-filled discourses on the Bhagvatam. Thanks to the excellent video arrangements, the thousands who came were all able to participate fully in all the celebrations. Next year we plan to go live on the Internet!

 

Jai Guru Dev
