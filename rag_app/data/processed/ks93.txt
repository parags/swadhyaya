A FRIEND IS AN ENEMY AND AN ENEMY IS A FRIEND

In the company of your friends, you lose your centeredness. Your enemy puts you back in yourself. Your friend sympathizes with you and makes you believe in matter. Your enemy makes you feel helpless and takes you to the spirit. So your enemy is your friend and your friend is your enemy!

Krishna said to Arjuna: One who is unfriendly everywhere (including himself); his consciousness is stable and awareness is established.

Jai Guru Dev

NEWS FLASH:

The residents of Rishikesh experienced the first rain in several months on the day Guruji arrived! Teachers from all over India have arrived for their annual meeting and refresher. Guruji is using this temporary respite to go through mountains of mail!

A team of doctors conducted a free medical camp in Urugalli, Karnataka, where over 2500 villagers were given diagnoses and medicines.

From four die-hard devotees rapidly recovering from a traffic accident from buoyant BARODA :

Thanks to Guruji's incredible grace and the loving seva of Baroda Satsangees, we are all strong and rejoicing. There is life on earth and life after death. For one brief moment, we were blessed with the vision of both. Now we are truly celebrating this life - its pain, humor, chaos and joy in total gratitude and surrender to the Divine.

Jai Guru Dev
