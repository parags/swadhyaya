You Are The Tenth

Ten people were going from one village to another. On the way they had to cross a river. After crossing they wanted to be sure all were there. Each one started counting but counted only nine. They were very distraught and began to cry for the loss of the tenth.

A wise man came along and asked them "Oh my dear friends, why are you crying?"

"We were ten but now we are only nine," they replied.

The wise man saw they were ten, so he asked them to count. Each counted nine but left out himself. Then the wise man made them stand and count, and he said to the last person, "You are the tenth!"

And they all rejoiced for having regained the tenth.

Similarly the five senses and the four inner faculties (mind, intellect, memory, ego) all lament when they lose sight of the Self. Then the Master comes and shows you that You are the tenth! Count, but never stop until you find the tenth. The joy is in finding the Ever Present.

With the knowledge of the Self inside everything is truly joyful.

Q: What did Brahma think when he made this creation?

Sri Sri: He didn't think before doing. He didn't take anyone's suggestion -- I would have given him a few.

NEWS FLASH: Bhajans were coming out from a locked suitcase! Do you think it was a miracle? No, it was a hoax. While being transported, a tape recorder inside was turned on by impact and brought great delight to the volunteers who worked into the early morning to prepare for the departure of the International Advanced Course participants. The course ended with the whole group joining Sri Sri for a dip in the Holy Ganga river. Another Advanced course is already underway in Rishikesh with four hundred participants, while TTC I and II are having a hilarious time. Everything is gearing up the Festival of Colors, Holi.

Jai Guru Dev
