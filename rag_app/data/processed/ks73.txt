IN THE SOLITUDE OF THE SELF

Jai Guru Dev !

Buddha is not on the peak, rather the peak is beneath Buddha. One who goes to the peak comes down, but the peak seeks the one who is stationed in the inner space.

Shiva is called Chandrasekhara which means that mind which is in the Shiva (transcendence) and is always above the peak.

Often people are running after parties and celebrations, but for the one who is not running after them, parties and celebrations follow him. If you are running after parties, loneliness comes to you, but if you are in the solitude of the Self, parties surround you.

NEWS FLASH

The final day of Navaratri saw people, including children, transfixed in one place for nine hours. The energy was so overpowering that even the puja vessels started to vibrate. The chanting of the priests were framed by Indian clarinet and drums and the silence came aloud.

Guruji arrived in Bombay (Mumbai) for a last-minute-notice Satsang of hundreds of people which was wild with singing and celebration.

Satsangs and celebration moved on to Hong Kong where two lectures are happening in the beautiful Hong Kong Science Museum.

Jai Guru Dev
