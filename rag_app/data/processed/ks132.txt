Weekly Knowledge #132	Banglore Ashram
18 Dec 1997	India
Faces Of Infinity

You have many faces. Only you don't face them. When you come face to face with your faces then conflicts, confusion and chaos arise in you.

From time to time in different phases, different faces appear. As you come close to your Being, all the faces melt and leave you as the Space that you are.

At the gross level, you identify yourself as somebody. At a subtle level, you identify yourself as some energy or an incarnation of some angel, saint or prophet.

When you go beyond even this identity, you are whole, holy, Brahman - Purna Brahman Narayana.

NEWS FLASH: The Ashram bid farewell to the Russians.... but Southeast Asians, Southern Africans, Malaysians and a LOT of Indians from all directions have occupied every available space.

Amidst the hectic activity in the Ashram, there is deep silence and serenity. The Advanced Course, TTC, Sahaj Samadhi Course, Basic Course and ART Excel are in full swing.

Jai Guru Dev
