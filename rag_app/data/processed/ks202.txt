BLESSING

Make your home God's home and there will be light, love and abundance.

Make your body God's abode and there will be peace and bliss.

Feel your mind as a toy of God and you'll watch and enjoy all its games.

See this world as play and as a display of God Himself and you will repose in the Non-Dual Self.

Blessing comes to you in many forms.

If you are generous, blessing comes to you as abundance.
If you are hardworking, blessing comes to you as happiness.
If you are lazy, blessing comes to you as hard work! (Laughter)
If you are pleasure loving, blessing comes to you as dispassion.
If you are dispassionate, blessing comes to you as knowledge of the Self.
