WISE ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE YOU CRY FOR THE DIVINE

Unfortunate are those who cry for the world.

Fortunate are those who cry for the Divine.

Unwise are those who make you cry for the world.

Wise are those who make you cry for the Divine.

The source of conflict is the division of "mine" and "yours." Knowledge eases the sense of limited belongingness and resolves this conflict.

It is amazing when knowledge dawns in you that there is no stranger in the whole world! At the same time, the nearest one remains unknown to you.

Shirish Suchak: Why do our nearest ones often remain strangers?

Sri Sri: Because no one can understand anyone totally. Life is a mystery!

Marcy: But Guruji, you understand us totally! (laughter)

Sri Sri: Wake up and see. All these distinctions Ö "me, mine, others" Ö simply dissolve.

NEWS FLASH

During the UN Millennium World Peace Summit in New York, the elders of the last of the Incas of Peru spotted Guruji and recognized Him as The Man Of Light. They bestowed their highest honor upon Him to the sounds of their ancient conches and flutes.

At the Montreal Ashram, Katherine called and "complained" that Sri Sri would not leave her Minolta digital camera. Each time she downloads the pictures and tries to erase them from the camera, one particular picture of Guruji always remains there!

After the "mini" Advanced Course over the Labor Day weekend, Sri Sri gave informal talks to packed halls in Montreal and Ottawa.

Sixteen fortunate devotees rose in Divine Love with the Master  in a hot-air balloon! When they were asked how they had felt being "in space" with Him, they gleefully replied, "Absolutely at home!"

Jai Guru Dev
