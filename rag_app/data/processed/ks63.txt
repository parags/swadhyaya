SURRENDER - SHAME AND SHYNESS

In surrender the head bends and meets the heart. The head that does not bend has no value, and the head that is stiff will have to bend sometime, either in surrender or in shame. The head that bends in surrender will never have to bend in shame. Shame accompanies arrogance. Shyness accompanies Love. See how children are endowed with shyness, that is natural. Shyness is inherent. Shame is inflicted by society and is acquired. Shame brings guilt and shyness adds to oneÒ³ beauty. Retain your shyness and drop your shame.

NEWS FLASH

Parag and Parul were taken by surprise when the food brought just for Guruji and four others was fed to forty people and still there was some left over.

The Advanced Teacher Training was immensely beneficial and the teachers left with renewed wisdom and fire.

As people would crowd into Verna's home and the slamming of car doors after midnight was awakening the entire Bayliss neighborhood, so Guruji played a trick and took everyone to the beach! A big group gathered in the airport, there was a change in flight, and the airport authorities requested our people not to crowd! Rajshree's family hosted a nice Satsang in Yonkers. A public Satsang was given for the first time in Princeton, New Jersey and the talk in New York was greatly admired by everyone. Guruji gave four television programs in this tour, including The Discovery Channel and Korean TV. Before boarding the plane to the UK, Guruji took a private visit to the amusement park (with only 40 people) and the water rides and the roller coaster were great fun.
