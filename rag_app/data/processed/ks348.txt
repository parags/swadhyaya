Praise the Fools!

Praising the fool is beneficial for society!

A fool when pleased might stop doing harm and start doing good work. In this sense it is wise to praise a fool as he needs motivation. So your praise is meaningful when it is directed towards a fool!

A wise man by his very nature will keep doing good work. His attitude does not depend on someone’s praise or blame. So it does not serve any purpose to praise a wise man because your praise cannot make an impact on him.

There are three types of people – the wise, the crooked and the immature.
Even if the wise man is scolded or praised, he continues doing good work.
The crooked need to be praised to do good work.
The immature however need to be both praised and scolded from time to time.

 News Flash:

A close associate of Osama Bin Laden, Mohammad Afroz, who is currently in the high security Bombay prison, was involved in the plan to blow up the London airport. He took the Prison SMART and was totally transformed. He wrote that he wished that all the Al Qaeda members would do the course which brought forth such a transformation in him. His desire is to become a teacher of AOL and bring peace and harmony to people!

At the same time Reverend Shri Shiva Muniji Maharaj, the proponent of non-violence (or Ahimsa) and the head of the Jain religion, was on the advanced course and proclaimed the fulfillment of the Jain religion from what he found in the AOL.

The third advanced course participants are soaking in bliss on the banks of the Ganga.

 

 

Jai Guru Dev
