SATSANG IS THE SHELTER

Why do people need homes? Can they live like animals in the forest without shelter? Even intelligent animals make their homes. Man needs protection from changing nature. So he builds a shelter for physical comforts. In the same way, for spiritual and mental comfort - Satsang is the shelter.

One who does not do Satsang is like a wild animal. Satsang alone makes one civilized. Satsang is the shelter from the changing times and its harsh influence on life.

Satsang is the nest in which you can rest.

If you are a taker of happiness, you get misery.

If you are a giver of happiness, you get joy and love.

NEWS FLASH:

As the month long stay in Rishikesh came to an end, many saints of the region came to greet Guruji and blessed the Art of Living family and wished he could stay there longer.

Enthusiastic devotees in Delhi had a farewell Satsang as the party boarded the flight to the East - to the City of Joy.

The big hoardings all over Calcutta attracted a big crowd and the Satsang was wonderful!

Jai Guru Dev
