EXPAND YOUR VICES

If you cannot get rid of vices, increase them. Worry, pride, anger, lust, grief - give them a bigger dimension and a different direction. Anger - what is the point of getting angry about small events? Be angry about the infinite, about Brahma.

Ego, pride - If you cannot get rid of pride, take pride in owning THE DIVINE.

Greed - Be greedy for SATSANG.

Craving - Crave for truth.

Aversion - Be averse to aversions.

Jealousy - Be jealous about SEVA.

Intoxication - Get intoxicated in the DIVINE.

Attachment - Attach yourself to the guru.

Joy is love for what is. Sorrow is love for what is not.

Jai Guru Dev
