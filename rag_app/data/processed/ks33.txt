ADVICE FROM HAWAII

 What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend. Such time you give. This is not quality time.

 Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.

We are making efforts to bring these tapes to you soon.

What is most freely given yet not taken?

1. Compliments? . . . no.

2. Blame? . . . no, people take blame.

3. Money? . . . no, money is readily taken, not freely given.

4. Happiness? . . . nobody can give happiness.

5. ??

The clue is that it hangs in space like an orphan. No one owns it. Like an overripe papaya in Hawaii, it rots.

The answer to this riddle lies in the beginning.

ALOHA!
