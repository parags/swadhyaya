SHARE YOUR JOY

By sharing your misery, it doesn't reduce. By not sharing your joy, it reduces. Share your problems only with the Divine, not with Tom, Dick, or Harry -- that just increases the problem. Share your joy with everybody.

Darren: How do you help people who share their misery with you?

Guruji: I have a thousand and one ways. Often it happens that when they share their problem with me, it is immediately resolved. Other times it requires some patience. Just know that all will be taken care of.

Mary: How do we help people who share their misery with us?

Guruji: Listen to others, yet don't listen. Because if your mind gets stuck there, not only are they miserable, you also get miserable.

Jai Guru Dev

NEWS FLASH

The full moon greeted the Master as he visited the island of Maui in Hawaii for the first time. A talk was given, then on to the island of Kauai at David and Gary's ashram home. Guruji had come to rest, but didn't rest, yet he was not restless. He outlined a new course for teenagers named ART Excell (All-Round-Training for Excellence). A talk in Honolulu completed his Hawaii "vacation."
