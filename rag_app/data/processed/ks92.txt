THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT

Being in a crowd when you are alone is ignorance. Enlightenment is being alone in a crowd. Feeling of oneness in a crowd is a sign of wisdom. Knowledge of life brings confidence, and knowledge of death makes you fearless and centered.

What is fear? Fear of separatedness.

Celebrate while you are alone and when you are with people. Some know to celebrate when they are in a crowd. Some can only rejoice alone in silence. I tell you to do both.

Celebrate the silence and Celebrate the noise.

Celebrate the life and Celebrate the death.

This is the Eleventh Commandment!

Jai Guru Dev

NEWS FLASH:

This week has been full of events.

The Divine Energy in the Ashram was at its peak on Shivaratri; Gurujis dance left everyone spellbound. Guruji went on to Ahmedabad, where over 8000 people packed a stadium for a delirious satsang.

The next day, one of The Art of Living Teachers passed away : Guruji embraced the bereaved family and in minutes lifted the gloom. This experience brought a depth and dispassion in the entire group, and they celebrated singing Jai Jai Radha Ramana Hari Bol . In death, as in life, Guruji was right there at the helm of everything. The entire family will be joining Guruji in Rishikesh.

Then on to Delhi, the spiritually saturated capital of India, where billboards were seen at every major intersection. The thrilling Satsang and meditation captivated the thousands present.
