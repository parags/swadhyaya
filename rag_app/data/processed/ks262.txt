ACTION AND REACTION

Action is out of conscious decision. Reaction is out of impulsiveness.

Impulsiveness creates a chain of Karma.

Reaction, as well as non-action, both create karma, but a conscious action transcends karma. Conscious action does not create new karma whereas

non-action can create karma.

For example, a soldier shooting in war does not create a karma; a policeman using tear gas does not create a Karma, and if you are a doctor and you do not give medicine to a patient in need, you are incurring a karma.

Through knowledge and devotion, transcend all karmas and be free!
