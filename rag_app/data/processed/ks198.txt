A PRAYER

Give me not thirst if you cannot give me water.
Give me not hunger if you cannot give me food.
Give me not joy if I cannot share.
Give me not the skills if I cannot put them to good use.

Give me not intelligence if I cannot perceive beyond it.
Give me not knowledge if I cannot digest it.
Give me not love if I cannot serve.
Give me not desire that doesn't lead me to you.
Give me not a path that doesn't take me home.
Give me not a prayer if you don't want to hear it. (Laughter)

Question 	
:
When you pray, to whom do you pray?

Sri Sri	
:
To myself! In prayer the mind goes to its source, the Self. God, Guru, and the Self are the same.
 	 
 	 	 
Dean says	
:
Give me not time if I don't know how to manage it.
Daniel says	
:
Gurudev says, "You're all out of time..." (Laughter)


NEWS FLASH: Guruji arrived in Singapore for a big Satsang in the football stadium. As usual, Nature cooperated by providing good weather. Then a Satsang in Kuala Lumpur. In Japan people called together others on their cell phones -- a spontaneous cellular Satsang! Sri Sri is now on Kauai, Hawaii, where the laughter here is competing with the waves on the ocean.
