DEVOTEE BECOMES GOD

When a river meets the ocean, the river no longer remains a river. It becomes the ocean. A drop of the ocean is part of the ocean. In the same way, the moment a devotee meets (surrenders to) the Divine, the devotee becomes GOD. When the river meets the ocean, it recognizes that it is the ocean from the beginning to the end. Similarly, the individual "IÅ® IÅ®" dissolves in ONE Divinity.

Question: What about backwaters?

Sri Sri: Sometimes the ocean goes into the river to greet it. Sometimes it seems that the ocean is pushing back the river. Similarly, the Divine puts many questions and doubts in the mind or gives an amazing experience to bring one back home.

 

NEWS FLASH

Construction activity for the big meditation hall, the big water tank and more residential facilities are in full swing to enable more devotees to participate in future celebrations.

Jai Guru Dev
