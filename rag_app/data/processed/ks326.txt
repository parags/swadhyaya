HONEY

Let the wind that blows be sweet

Let the oceans flow honey

Let all the herbs and plant kingdom be favourable to us

Let the nights be sweet and let the days be sweet

Let the dust of this planet be sweet to us

Let the heavens and our forefathers be sweet to us

Let all the trees be laden with honey

Let the Sun be sweet to us (Let all the radiations be favourable to us)

Let all the animals be sweet to us

Let our food be favourable to us

Let all our thoughts and our speech be sweet like honey

 

Let our life be pure and divine,

Let it be sweet like honey.

The One who has made our life sweet as honey is in silence!
