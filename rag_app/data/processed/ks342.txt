The Subtle Truth About Virtues

If we observe our behavior, we procrastinate doing something good but we are in a hurry when it comes to doing something bad. For example if we are angry we want to express it immediately and not wait.

Do you know WHY? Because virtues are your very nature and they will never leave you. Your vices are not your nature and they will leave you. The negative tendencies are transient and they will leave you if you do not act on them. Frustration, crying cannot stay for long, at least with the same intensity. Perhaps we are concerned that the vices will leave us if we do not act on them.

It is only wise to postpone the vices for they will not stay and act immediately for doing good, otherwise we will keep postponing the good for the next few lifetimes. (Laughter!!!)

News Flash:

There was an attempt during the World Economic Forum to divide the religious communities into monotheistic or polytheistic. This was given up at Gurujiâ€™s insistence and harmony finally prevailed. Leaders from all religious communities, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, agreed to drop this draft resolution as Guruji had desired.

An Advanced Course with people from 37 countries is in progress at the Bangalore Ashram.

Jai Guru Dev
