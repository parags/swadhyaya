How To Get Centred

Shifting the awareness from the experience to the experiencer; since all

the experiences are on the circumference and they keep on changing.

The experiencer is at the centre.

Again and again come back to the experiencer.

If you are frustrated, instead of spending all the time on the experience

of frustration, ask Who is frustrated?

Similarly, if you are unhappy, ask Who is unhappy?

If you think you know something, ask Who knows it? (Laughter)

If you think you are enlightened, ask Who is enlightened? (Laughter)

If you think you are ignorant, ask Who is ignorant?

If you think you are poor me, ask Who is poor me?

If you think you are highly devoted, ask Who is devoted?

Shed all your faces and face the I.

Then you have truly come to Me!
