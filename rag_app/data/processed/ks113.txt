Sacrifice

Sacrifice is letting go of something that you are holding on to or are attached to, which gives you pleasure, for something bigger that would bring good.

Sacrifice brings strength in life. Life without sacrifice is stagnant. Sacrifice gives you the quantum leap. It takes you to a higher pedestal.

Often people think sacrifice makes life dull and joyless. In fact, it is the sacrifice which makes life worth living.

The amount of sacrifice in your life brings out your magnanimity and helps you move out of misery.

A life without sacrifice is worth nothing. Zeal, enthusiasm, strength and joy are all connected to sacrifice.

Question: Some people say, "I have sacrificed so much," and complain.

Answer: That is good. The thought of sacrifice has given them strength to complain and saves them from blaming themselves without which they would even be more depressed.

Sacrifice never goes unrewarded.

There can be no love, no wisdom and no true joy without sacrifice.

SACRIFICE MAKES YOU SACRED. Become sacred!

NEWS FLASH

As you all know, our Art of Living team of three teachers had gone to facilitate in the peace process between Armenia and Azerbaidzhan in Karabakh. In the short span of only two weeks they have come out with flying colors in their mission.

Three courses with 40 participants each of Army officials and another series of courses for civilians had been conducted.

There was an article in the Moscow Times saying that the fighting factions had agreed to stop fighting only two weeks after our team started work there. This was reported in the newspapers and television shows.

From Bad Antogast: Can you imagine, translations in ten languages are happening simultaneously and the course participants all speak in one language -- silence.
