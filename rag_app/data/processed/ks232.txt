INTENTION

Intentions keep the tension in. Being hollow and empty means dropping all intentions. Within tension, rest does not become deep. Devotion dissolves intentions. Intention pushes you to the future. Bliss is always present. The one who wakes up to this truth is wise. In a state of bliss, once in a while, if an intention comes up, it manifests effortlessly. The more intentions you have, the more in tension you will be. To minimize your intentions could be your last intention.

NEWS FLASH

Guruji's stay in India concluded with a grand celebration with more than seven thousand people from all over Bangalore. The Bangalore devotees published a bhajan cassette and a beautiful pictorial book in memory of Amma. The AoL was invited by leaders of the Jain community to join them in the celebration of the 2600 anniversary of Mahavir's birth. We were also invited to participate in the millennium celebration with the Dalai Lama at Varanasi.

The brightest moon of the millennium lit up the snow and smiling faces that welcome Guruji to his home in Europe.

Jai Guru Dev
