The Five Insights

Love is your nature.

In the process of its expression, you often get caught up in the object. This is when your sight is caught outside. To return back to your nature, you need insight.

Pain is the first insight.

It takes you away from the object and turns you towards your body and mind.

Energy is the second insight.

A bolt of energy brings you back to your Self.

Divine Love is the third insight.

A glimpse of Divine love makes you so complete and over rules all the relative pleasures.

Trance is the fourth insight.

An elevation of consciousness and partial awareness of the physical reality around is Trance.

Non-dual existence, that all is made up of one and only one, is the fifth insight.

When love glows, it is bliss,

When it flows, it is compassion,

When it blows, it is anger,

When it ferments, it is jealously,

When it is all Nos, it is hatred,

When it acts, it is perfection,

When love Knows, it is ME!
