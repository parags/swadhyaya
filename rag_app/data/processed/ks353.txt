THE STRENGTH OF COMMITMENT

Question: Why is it easier for some of us to commit to our own welfare rather than that of others?

Sri Sri: Because you do not know that whatever you are committed to brings you strength.
If you are committed to your family then your family supports you, if you are committed to your society, you enjoy the support of society. If you are committed to God, God gives you strength. If you are committed to Truth, Truth brings you strength.

Often one is not aware of this idea and that is why one is hesitant to commit to a greater cause. Also there is a fear that commitment would weaken one or take away one's freedom. Your commitment to a cause is bound to bring you comfort in the long run.

Commitment in life grows toward a higher cause. The higher the commitment, greater is the good for all.

Noah: Why don't we make any vows in the Art of Living?

Sri Sri: When the path is charming, commitment is effortless and is part of your nature.

Mikey: In Art of Living we don't make vows, we have Wows! (laughter)
