I AM NEITHER HONEST NOR HUMBLE!!

A lady - I want an honest and humble man in my life.

Sri Sri - I am neither honest nor humble. (Everyone shocked)

Sri Sri - I cannot tell everyone I am God, as not everyone will understand.

So I am not honest. I am not humble - how can God be humble!

If I am humble I am not honest.

If I'm honest I can not be humble!!! (Laughter)

Hide your dispassion and express your love. By expressing dispassion you lose enthusiasm in life. And by not expressing love you feel stifled. Expressing dispassion may bring ego. Hide dispassion in your heart like the roots of a tree. And express love like a ripe fruit.

NEWS FLASH

Guruji had given perfume to Mr. Salim, a devotee from Kollam. He called back to say that though he sprayed the perfume on so many people, to everyone's amazement the bottle stays full.

Jai Guru Dev
