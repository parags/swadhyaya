Protection and Transformation

Only that which is temporary, small or perishable needs protection, while that which is permanent, big or vast does not.
Your body needs protection, your soul does not.
Your mind needs protection, the Self does not.

Protection simply means prolonging the time. Protection also prevents transformation. Transformation cannot happen in protection.

At the same time, without protection the desired transformation cannot happen. A seed needs protection to transform into a plant, a plant needs protection to become a tree.
Protection can aid or hamper transformation. The protector should have an idea to what extent he should protect.

Kashi says: Grace brings transformation with protection.

Truth does not need any protection. Both protection and transformation come within the purview of time and space and these laws have to be honoured in order to transcend time.

We are both protected and transformed - that is Hari and Hara. Hari - the protector and Hara - the transformer.

Protection is limited to Time, to perishable things. How long can a doctor can heal or protect someone? Forever? No!

Peace and happiness don't need protection because they are not temporary.
