INDIGESTION OF KNOWLEDGE

Indigestion of knowledge leads to development of a false ego which has no cure. Knowledge must be digested properly.

Indigestion of knowledge leads to:

False ego
Disinterestedness; taking for granted; lack of awareness
Familiarity without understanding, without depth -- flakiness
Tendency to preach
"Heart" burn
Using knowledge for their own small ends
Adamancy
Your inability to do something (break a habit) can cause a pinch; when you are deeply pained by something, then that will rid you of that habit. If you are pained by your shortcomings, then you are sadhak. Pain takes you out of addiction.

If you are in love with the divine, then you can digest the knowledge. Love is the appetizer -- seva is the exercise -- without love and seva, knowledge becomes indigestible. So everyone list the loving seva you have done for the world.

Marielle: If love is the appetizer, what is the main course?

Guruji: Knowledge

Daniel: What is dessert?

Guruji: MYSELF!! (Laughter)

 

Jai Guru Dev

NEWS FLASH

Reverend Michael Bechwith, founder of the Agape Church, honored Guruji to his congregation. Everyone felt the unity inspired by the songs from the church choir and Bhajans by Divya followed by electrifying talks. Monday Guruji started a series of talks to an overflowing crowd at the Miramar Sheraton Hotel. A lady in her 50s who had an accident and lost mobility in her arm, came the next day and was amazed that she could now easily lift her arm all the way over her head. There was an air of celebration and everyone coming to the talks was simply ecstatic.
Jai Gurudev
