DESIRE AND JOY

All desires are for happiness. That is the goal of desire, isn't it? How often does your desire lead you to the goal? But have you thought about the nature of desire? It simply means tomorrow, and not now, isn't it? Joy is never tomorrow. It is always now.

How can you have desires when you are joyful? And how can you really be joyful now when you have desires? Desire appears to lead you to happiness. In fact it cannot. And that is why it is Maya. What do you say?

 

Jai Guru Dev

 

 

NEWS FLASH

Guruji arrived on the 28th in Bangalore without his baggage. And he said that is how he came to the World -- without any baggage!

An advanced course at the Ashram with participants from all corners of India was conducted from the first to the fifth of March. The Ashram was bustling with activity. Despite a large number of young devotees, the course was unusually silent.

The silence was broken with the boisterous celebration of Holi -- the festival of colors.

We had Satsang in the open air. The sound of the drums and the beat of the heart were magical and brought laughter and tears together in everybody. The full moon was so full and everyone was soaked in bright colors.
