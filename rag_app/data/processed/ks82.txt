NEW YEAR CELEBRATION

The year 1997 is fortunate because you are living at this time. When you are living for the sake of the world, the world is fortunate. You are not living for yourself, but for the world. Whatever the world needs or wants, you are there for that. So the year is fortunate that you are on the earth at this point in time.

Let the time celebrate your presence. You keep smiling as ever. Usually people make a wish for the New Year. This year, make no wish. Let the New Year celebrate you. If it wants to bring you nicer things, let it. It's up to it.

Usually you are lost in celebration. When you let time celebrate you, you are a witness amidst celebration.
