Shiva and Krishna Are One

Angels are a part of the Big Self. The infinity has diverse qualities, and specific qualities assume names. They are called Angels. Angels are nothing but a ray of your Big Self. They are there to serve you when you are centered. Like roots and stems and leaves come out of a seed when it is sprouted, all the Angels in your life manifest when you are centered. Angels rejoice in your company, but you have nothing to gain from them. They only come around those who have nothing to gain from them. Angels are like your extended arms. Like all the colors are present in the white sunlight, all the Angels are present in your higher self. Bliss is their breath, dispassion their abode. The consciousness which is bliss, innocence, omnipresent, and the bestower of dispassion is Shiva. Krishna is the outer manifestation of Shiva. And Shiva is the inner silence of Krishna.

Jai Guru Dev

NEWS FLASH:

The Governor of Hawaii and the mayor of Honolulu each wrote letters to Guruji welcoming Him and expressing appreciation for Guruji's work in Hawaii. The anxious devotees in Jakarta had made extensive and elaborate reception plans at the airport. Guruji played a trick, with John's help, and arrived one day early, foiling their plans! The new ashram under construction in Jakarta, funded entirely by donations from devotees, will be ready for occupancy in approximately four months. Packed satsangs and packed tummies were enjoyed by all - especially Guruji. The entourage then arrived in Singapore for more celebrations and food and they look forward to a cruise in the Indian ocean.

Jai Gurudev !
