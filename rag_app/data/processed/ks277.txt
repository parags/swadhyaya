THE BODHI TREE

Buddha got enlightened under the Bodhi tree. He then stood up and watched the tree from a distance for seven days. He took sixteen steps towards the tree and under each step, blossomed a Lotus flower. This is the legend.

The Bodhi tree is symbolic of both sansara (world) and Dharma. The Lotus flower symbolizes clarity, dispassion, love, beauty and purity.

It is only when you are detached in life can you watch the sansara and all of its plays. When you witness the sansara, every step you take is benevolent and impeccable. When every action of yours is preceded by witnessing then every move you make in this sansara becomes perfect and significant.

 

 

NEWS FLASH

Guruji's entourage moved to Jamshedpur where a crowd of more than 20,000 was enthralled by the Master. Then on to Ranchi where another 60,000 were soaked in His Grace. Later in the night, Guruji met with more than a thousand villagers who came just to have a glimpse of Him.

The City of Joy (Calcutta) was full of enthusiasm. Guruji addressed the C.I.I. (Confederation of Indian Industries). Guruji's program in Calcutta was three satsangs - back to back over two days. Hundreds and thousands of people enjoyed the hospitality of West Bengal. Devotees were doubly stunned when an aggressive heckler was instantly transformed into a seeker and

danced in joy.

Then Guruji moved on to Gaya to offer tribute to His most beloved mother, our Amma, on her first death anniversary. And once again the Bodhi tree had another date with the Enlightened.
