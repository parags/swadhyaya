DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT

Just like you run out of fuel in the car and you have to refill it again and again, in the same way your dedication and commitment runs out in the course of time and it needs constant renewal!

You have to dedicate and rededicate again and again.

Often people take their dedication for granted and then the mind starts demanding or complaining. When dedication is not complete, it leads to grumbling and complaints.

Total dedication brings enormous enthusiasm, zeal, trust, and challenge, and does not leave any room for ego.

NEWS FLASH:

Spring was in full swing in Bad Antogast (German Ashram). As it was in nature, so it was in all the hearts.

The first silent seeds were sown in Austria. A bus full of devotees came all way from Croatia driving for eight to ten hours to meet Guruiji for just a couple of hours in Vienna.

Today's full moon is dedicated to Buddha and now it is time to rededicate oneself.

Jai Guru Dev
