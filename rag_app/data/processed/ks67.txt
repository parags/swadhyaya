THE FALL THAT RAISES

You only see the fall of the water. You don’t see how the Ocean becomes the Cloud. The ocean becoming the cloud is a secret, but the cloud becoming the ocean is obvious.

In the world only a few can notice your inner growth and height, but your outer expressions are apparent.

Never brood that people don’t understand you. They can only see your expression!

NEWS FLASH

RIDDLE: The first Advanced Course started after the first Advanced Course ended. Actually it was the third Advanced Course. Now the second Advanced Course has started, but actually it is the fourth.

On the Ganesha festival day, Guruji gave a most revealing talk on Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity -- its name, form, quality and many secrets.

Guruji was invited to inaugurate the Shiva temple and the Satang hall at Adichunchinagiri Mutt Blind School. All the 125 teacher trainees, in several buses and cars, accompanied Guruji to the inauguration and them proceeded to the waterfalls.

It was an exquisite evening. Nature was brilliantly displaying herself in all her glory -- pink and golden skies with spectacular cloud patterns, rolling hills, clement weather, MAGNIFICENT waterfalls...

Dinesh: We should have come here without you Guruji.

Everybody was shocked because they went to the falls because Guruji went.

Dinesh: Now we are only looking at you. (Applause)

Guruji: Hmmm... Look at the water. Even the fall is beautiful. If a rock falls it shatters, but when water falls it generates power and beauty. Being somebody is being like a stone, being nobody is being like the water. Being everybody is like water vapor.

Bharat: More people are interested in news than Knowledge.

Bawa: Then we will put more Knowledge in the news.

Jai Guru Dev
