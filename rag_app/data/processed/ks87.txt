UNKNOWN KNOWLEDGE

Do you recall this from last week's Knowledge sheet?

"P.S. Next week everyone write a knowledge sheet with your news flash and send it with your name on it. Fax it to 1-805-565-3538 (USA) or mail it to your national center."

It seems that Guruji was serious. He was asked last night about the missing Knowledge and He said that He was looking forward to reading other people's Knowledge sheets rather than sending out one. He said that people read the Knowledge and forget it so He wants people to write their own this time.

Jai Guru Dev

NEWS FLASH:

Guruji is in Philadelphia today, New Jersey tomorrow, and Florida on Sunday for a week-long silence course.
