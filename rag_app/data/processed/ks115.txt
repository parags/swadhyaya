RAKSHA BANDHAN

This full moon is dedicated to the seers -- the rishis. It is also called the raksha bandhan. Bandhan means bondage, raksha means protection. A bondage that protects you. Your bondage to the knowledge, to the master, to the truth, To The Self, All Saves You. A Rope Can Be Tied To Either Protect Or Strangle You. The Small Mind And Mundane Things can strangle you. The big mind or knowledge saves you. Raksha bandhan is that bondage that saves you.

You are bound by your bondage to the satsang. Your bondage to the master, to the truth, to the ancient knowledge of the rishis is your savior.

Bonding is essential in life. And let the bonding be divine in a life free from bondage.
