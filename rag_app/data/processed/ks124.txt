FEEL BLESSED

Break through all the barriers and feel that you Are Blessed. This Is The One And Only Step You Have To take - the rest will all happen.

This deep sense of feeling that "I am blessed" can help you overcome any obstacles in life. It gives you courage and confidence and it will open your lid for grace to be poured in.

Once you realize that you are blessed, then:

All the complaints disappear

All the grumbling disappears

All the insecurities disappear

A sense of feeling unloved disappears

Wanting love disappears.

If you don't realize you are blessed, then the doership begins. If you want to make a difference in your life, feel you are blessed. And especially for those on this path of knowledge, there is no reason for you to not feel blessed.

So, feel you are blessed.

This is the first step towards the Self.

NEWS FLASH Thousands thronged the two Satsangs in Coimbatore to glimpse Sri Sri. In the morning, it was a treat to experience 1800 people doing pranayama and Kriya together!
