A LIAR IS INNOCENT

 A dear person whom you trust lies to you and gets caught. What do you feel?

1. Sadness

2. Anger

3. Cheated

4. Disappointment

5. Compassion

6. Let down

7. Loss of respect

8. Wonder

9. Shock

10. Embarrassment

Recently when someone lied to me, I felt happy and more love, for they were not a good liar. Had they been a good liar, they would not have been caught. I thought they were so innocent that they could not even lie properly. They lie and get caught. If they had not been caught, how would you know they were a liar? So . . . you can never know a good liar. The person you call a liar is not a good liar and they are innocent. Aren't they?

And so . . . ha ha (laugh). You need not go through all the listed mental gymnastics. Instead melt and dissolve in Love.

 

Jai Guru Dev
