PROBLEM

Guruji says: There is no problem that cannot be solved!!!

Someone says: I have a few I can give you. (Laughter)

Guruji says: When you have a problem and you think it cannot be solved, then you have accepted it then it is no longer a problem; it is a fact.

For example: Suppose you think it is a problem that the ocean in Norway is too cold. Obviously, you cannot heat the ocean. If it cannot be solved, you accept it and it's no longer a problem. Only when you are searching for a solution is there a problem and so there is no problem that cannot be solved. (Laughter)

The moment you realize there is no solution, a problem ceases to be a problem.

The solution is the tail of every problem.

Solutions come to you when :
     You are calm and collected
     You use intelligence
     You are not lethargic but active
     You have strong faith in Divine law

Kai says: If you don't want any problems, you can have a Guru.

Sheila says: If you want all the problems of all the people, become a Guru.

Tom says: Focusing on the problem alone, you cannot solve it. But, when you go step up to your real need, your real goal, to the higher Self, you find many solutions.

NEWS FLASH: Spontaneous and contagious laughing meditations followed Guruji's public talks in Hamburg and Oslo. Snow followed Gurudev from Dallas to Oslo . Riding the waves of bliss, Guruji's giggling Gopi Gang went ice skating. On to Copenhagen tomorrow.
