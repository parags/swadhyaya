LIFE WITHOUT WISDOM IS INCOMPLETE

Wisdom that doesn't give rise to feeling is incomplete.

Feeling that doesnâ€™t translate into action is incomplete.

Action that doesn't give rise to fulfillment is incomplete.

For Fulfillment, is returning to the Self.

NEWS FLASH

Art of Living is actively involved in protecting the environment. About 80 full-grown 100 year old trees were saved from illegal felling through the prompt action of Art of Living.

In North Gujarat, were thousands of cattle were dying of starvation and lack of water, Art of Living has started a huge "Cattle Camp" to accommodate around 1,500 cattle.
