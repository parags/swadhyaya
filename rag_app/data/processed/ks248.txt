RAM NAVAMI

"Ra" in Sanskrit means "That which is Radiant" and "Ma" stands for "Myself".

That which shines forth within me, is Rama.

That which is radiant in every particle of the Being is Rama.

Rama is born to Dasharatha and Kaushalya. Dasharatha (In Sanskrit this means "the ten charioted one") signifies the five organs of sense and the five organs of action. Kaushalya (Sanskrit for "skilled") stands for skill. The skillful reiner of the ten chariots can give birth to Ram. When the ten are used skillfully, radiance is born within.

Rama was born in Ayodhya (Sanskrit for "the place where no war can happen"). When there is no conflict in our mind, then the radiance can dawn.

Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, was born of Sumitra Ã– the good friend. When the ten are cooperating with you then Awareness is born.

Often we try to look for radiance within. Just realize that you are radiant. Once when Guruji was 5 or 6 years old, he closed his eyes and asked a visiting saint, "Swamiji, I do not see any light". The saint replied, "You are the light! How can you see the light?"
