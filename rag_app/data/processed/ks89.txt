SEVA BLESSINGS

When you do seva don't think you are doing a favor for somebody. You have done the seva and it has rewarded you immediately. Its reward is for sure and is always more than your doing. Your expectation of reward for the seva turns the seva into labor. If you think you have done a lot, you will do very little; if you see you have done a little, then you will do more. Seva is even when you don't see an immediate reward there is no complaint; labor is even after an immediate reward, there will be complaints. Be grateful for any opportunity to do the seva.

Jai Guru Dev

NEWS FLASH

The GGE lessened PPS. Or did it??? But the GGE was interrupted by a devotee air line pilot with "one quick question". Like the professional translator in Costa Rica who got spaced out and could not translate, the air hostesses lost their minds and found their hearts becoming instant Gopis.

When you REST in the self, dynamic activity happens around you.

TRANSLATIONS:

GGE - Guru's Great Escape (from the hectic tour schedule for a few days rest wich turned out to be even more active.)

PPS - Post Punditiji Syndrome

REST - Responsibility, Enthusiasm, Seva and Tenacity
