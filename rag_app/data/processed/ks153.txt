INTENSIFY YOUR LONGING

Attainment Of The Divine Depends On The Intensity Of Longing And Not On The Time And Qualification.

There is a proverb among the villagers in India, which says that it may take some time to pluck a flower but it takes no time to meet the Divine ! Abilities, qualifications are not the criteria. It is simply the intensity of your longing.

Intensify your longing for the Divine right away. This you can do when you know that you want nothing and you are nothing.

Suneeta: If we are nothing and we want nothing, how can longing come?

Sidappa: Knowing you are nothing and you want nothing brings belongingness:

....and belongingness intensifies longing.

Bill: What is the difference between desire and longing?

Sri Sri: Desire is the fever of the head. Longing is the cry of the heart.

NEWS FLASH!

The Ashram is buzzing with activity. One Advanced Course ended and another began, along with the Indian Teachers Meet. Teacher Training Phase 1 and Phase ll and Art Excel too! Ashram housing has overflowed into neighbouring resorts and hostels. Everyone felt the dire need for a bigger meditation hall and dining hall-huge tents were pitched for meditation.

Even as this shortage was felt, Sri Sri came up with yet another project -Health, Hygiene, Home and Higher states of consciousness- the 4 H's. In less than an hour, inspired devotees took up seva projects to provide drinking water, toilets, prayer halls and over 600 houses for the homeless in the rural districts all over India.

Vikram: Someone should take up a similar project for the Ashram.

Jai Guru Dev
