WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF LOVE

When you love someone you dont see anything wrong in them. Even if you see some fault in them you justify the fault and say Well everyone does it, it is normal. You think you have not done enough for them. The more you do, the more you want to do for them. They are always in your mind. Ordinary things become extraordinary. For eg. A baby winking at grandmother. You want them to be yours exclusively. When you love someone, you want to see them always happy and you want them to have the best . You get hurt even over small things.

When you say Best Wishes, you imply that they are not best NOW I tell you, NOW is the best. If you realise this tomorrow can only be better.

NEWS FLASH ! !

Guruji visited Japan for three days. A group of 25 people travelled with Guruji to Kakagoa International Centre for a wonderful talk. Kobe had a beautiful Satsang, then the group went to Tokyo and Guruji stayed with his classmate. Laudable team work made possible exuberant Satsangs filled with tears of love and gratitude. It was amazing to see people from all walks of life and culture simply melting in love.

From there the group went to Hong Kong. The new Hong Kong International Airport reverberated with sounds of Jai Jai Radha Ramana Hari Bole by enthusiastic devotees. Lots of devotees flew from mainland China and Taipei to be with Gurudev. Well organised Satsang had about 1000 people.

Guruji arrived at midnight in Delhi amidst singing of bhajans by around 100 people at the airport. A prestigios venue Indian Habitat Centre is awaiting a talk on Spirituality in the new millennium by Guruji where leading dignitaries are expected to attend. Two other large Divya Satsangs are in the offing during Gurujis short stay at Delhi.
