Letting Go of Control

Many have a problem of letting go of control. This results in anxiety, restlessness and it sours relationships.

Wake up and see, are you really in control? What are you in control of? Perhaps a tiny part of your waking state! Isn’t that so?

You are not in control when you are sleeping or dreaming.
You are not in control of thoughts and emotions coming to you. You may choose to express it or not, but they come to you without your prior permission!
You realize that most of the functions of your body are not in your control, and the same for your life and the whole universe.
Similarly, do you think you are in control of all the events in your life or in the world? That is a joke!

When you look at things from this angle you need not be afraid of losing control, because you have none!

Whether you realise it or not, when you let go of your sense of control that is when you truly relax. Your identification of being somebody does not let you relax totally and it keeps your domain limited.

News Flash:

The highlights of Guruji’s Chennai visit were Maha Satsang, Maha Kriya, Rudra Pooja, free medical camps, and more.

This year was a change from the usual Christmas routine -- Guruji was in the Bangalore Ashram to celebrate Christmas with ashramites staging a play of the birth of Christ.

A white blanket of snow covered the Black Forest to welcome Guruji to the German Ashram.

The European Teacher’s Meet is underway in full zest and vigour.

Jai Guru Dev
