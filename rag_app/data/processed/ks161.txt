It Takes Courage To Say "I Am"

Only in deep rest can the Divine come, not by doing. All the doings are to help you become silent. Not enjoying the bliss or the peace takes you further - otherwise the bliss or the peace can create cravings. If the existence wants to give it, then fine. It takes courage to say "I am". Your true nature is bliss. But trying to enjoy the bliss, you step down from is-ness to am-ness - "l am peaceful", "I am blissful". And that is followed by "I am miserable". "l am" is dispassion. You can be anywhere and be dispassionate. Dispassion is welcoming everything. Centeredness brings energy, a spark. Enjoyment of bliss brings inertia. If you are dispassionate, the bliss is still there. When the freezer is full of ice cream you do not bother about it. Dispassion takes away the sense of scarcity. Passion is a sense of lack of abundance. And whenever everything is abundance, dispassion happens. And when dispassion is there, everything comes in abundance.

Q: What do we do when we catch ourselves enjoying our bliss?

Guruji: Then we feel stupid. Just an understanding we are enjoying it, creates a shift. There is no effort. Knowledge is better than action to make you free.

NEWSFLASH

To the sweet strains of Om Namo Bhagavate the course participants seemed to float across the stage for Guru Purnima blessings from Sri Sri. The Guru Purnima gathering included a combined weekend and six day Basic Course, an Advanced Course, TTC I, II, III, Parenting the Angels, and an ArtExcel program; all this under the snow-capped mountains and crystal skies of Alpine Meadows. The ArtExcel youths showed their spirit by kidnapping Sri Sri for an afternoon of ice-skating and laughter. As the courses wrap up, the excitement of the North American tour continues to unfold with the San Francisco Bay area, Colorado, and Canada to come.

Jai Guru Dev
