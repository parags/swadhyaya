CELEBRATING THE SILENCE

One who has given everything has also given freedom: Honor the freedom first and make good use of all things given to you.

Your sankalpas (intentions) and desires separate you from God.

Offer all the desires and your sankalpas to the Divine... then you are divine... you are God... you are free... lacking nothing.

Effort is the key in the relative,

Effortlessness is the key to the Absolute.

Your mind does not belong to you. Don't blame it.

Let the BIG SELF embrace it.

NEWS FLASH

SILENCE!

Jai Guru Dev
