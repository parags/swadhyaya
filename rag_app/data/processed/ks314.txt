WORRY AND FEELINGS

The head worries and the heart feels.  They cannot function at the same time.

When your feelings dominate, worry dissolves.

If you worry a lot, your feelings are dead; you are stuck in the head. Worrying makes your mind and heart inert and dull. Worries are like a rock in the head. Worry entangles you.  Worry puts you in a cage.

When you feel, you do not worry.

Feelings are like flowers, they come up, they blossom and they die. Feelings rise, they fall and then disappear. When feelings are expressed, you feel relieved. When you are angry, you express your anger and the next moment you are all right.  Or you are upset, you cry and you get over it.

Feelings last for some short time and then they drop, but worry eats at you for a longer period of time, and eventually eats you up.

Feelings make you spontaneous.  Children feel, so they are spontaneous. Adults put brakes on their feelings and they start worrying.  Worrying about anything obstructs action while feelings propel action.  Worrying about negative feelings is a blessing because it puts the brakes on those feelings, preventing you from acting on them.  Usually one never worries about positive feelings.  Worries are uncertain.  Worrying takes away your energy; you cannot think clearly when you worry.

Offering your worries is prayer and prayer moves you in feelings.

When you think you are feeling too much then you start worrying about your feelings.  Letâ€™s not worry about it and feel our food!
