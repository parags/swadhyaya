ABIDING IN THE SELF

 Abiding in the self you become the valentine for the whole world. Spirit is the valentine of matter and matter is the valentine of the spirit. They are made for each other. They uphold each other. If you hold onto matter and do not respect the spirit, then matter is not pleased. If you honor the spirit then you will care for the world, and when you care for the world, it will take care of you.

 I am the valentine of the whole world and I reside in every heart. If you are my valentine, you will see me everywhere. Have the same love for everyone, with different flavors. You cannot behave the same way with everyone, but you can love all of them the same. Love transcends behavior and etiquette.

 

 NEWS FLASH

 Just a week before Guruji's arrival, Raj woke up in the middle of the night in Loughborough. He thought that some light was coming from the clock. He looked at Guruji's picture and saw that light was coming from it. This light grew and filled the room. He made sure that there was no outside light left on. The divine light stayed on for about ten minutes.

 Upholland, Lancashire held an advanced course in Guruji's presence.

Guruji gave a talk on Ayurveda and the Art of Living at the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hall was full to capacity with standing room only, attended by medical professionals. It was a brilliant talk, but Punditji did not think so! He thought it was very mundane! There was great enthusiasm, however.

 Next, Guruji's entourage moved with luggage and cars at its own speed and proceeded to Stourbridge in the Midlands for a talk organized by Stourbridge Earth Mysteries. The talk was simply great! The entourage then moved on to London, arriving at 3 o' clock in the morning for "The UK Tired of Living Teacher's Meeting" with baggage, blankets, pillows, plastic bags, pots and pans, and the usual divine chaos!!
