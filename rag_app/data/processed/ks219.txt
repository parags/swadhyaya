TWO ANECDOTES

Once somebody made a mistake and Guruji asked him, "What punishment can I give you?"

The person replied, "Don't punish me, Guruji, I won't make the mistake again."

After some time Guruji asked another person, "And what punishment can I give you?"

With a bright smile Nityanand replied, "Any punishment, Guruji."

At this Guruji turned to the rest of us with a smile and said, "See, he is so confident of my love for him that he is not afraid of any punishment.

Where there is love, there is no fear.
Do not be afraid of being punished by God.
Trust in the love that He has for you."

It was Arun and Chitra's wedding anniversary. They presented an ornate fan to Guruji, saying, "A fan from two grateful fans."

At this Guruji said, "Devotees are the fan; God is the air. Air is always there, but the fans make you feel it. God is always there; devotees make His presence felt!"

 

And three more miracles

On a domestic flight in the US, Manjesh's mother fainted. A checkup showed that the aorta had dilated; the doctors suggested an immediate operation. She visited Guruji in San Jose, and when she went for a checkup again, the aorta was back to its normal size! The doctors could not believe this miracle.

Mr Sardana from Delhi could not even walk - he was advised a heart transplant and total bed rest. He somehow made it to both the Basic and Advanced Courses, and his doctors were amazed to find his heart absolutely normal! Now he walks happily all over the ashram.

In Deesa, Gujarat, a boy who was deaf-mute since birth, started speaking and hearing after his first Sudarshan Kriya!

Many such experiences are being reported from all over.

Lord Krishna's birthday was celebrated in all gaiety at the Ashram. Young and younger devotees danced and played, transported back five thousand years!

Bangalore city saw its biggest ever satsang this week.

 

Jai Guru Dev
