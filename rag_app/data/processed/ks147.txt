Impression And Expression

Do not make an effort to impress others, or to express yourself. Your effort to express yourself becomes an impediment. Your effort to impress someone also becomes futile. If you do not try to impress, expression comes naturally. When you come from the self, your expression is perfect and your impression lasts for ages.

Often you don't seem to have a control over your impressions and expressions. Wisdom is selecting your impressions and expressions. Enlightenment is when you do not take any impressions at all, whether good or bad. Then you "master" the art of expression. Many impressions in the mind cause:

- Confusion

- Distraction

- Chaos

- Lack of focus

- and finally, derangement of the mind.

Nature has inbuilt in us a system through which it releases some of the impressions - through dreams, and through meditation.

Excessive expression loses the depth and luster, the serenity of yourself. Meditation erases the impressions and improves the expression.

NEWS FLASH: Nitin and Bharat mentioned to Sri Sri that now he needs security guards. The next day, the govt. of Himachal Pradesh provided pilot cars and security for his entire trip in the Himalayan state. Watch out what you ask for in Sri Sri's presence! Sri Sri had a whirlwind tour of Himachal Pradesh, with Satsang in Kalka, Shimla and Nahan and then in Delhi and NOIDA - a true magical experience. Those who traveled with Sri Sri marveled at his stamina and unconditional love.

Then on to Calcutta - the City of Joy - where Sri Sri was seen smiling from nook and corner - huge hoardings, TV screens even movie theaters. The stage is set for two grand Satsangs, where thousands are eagerly awaiting the Master.

In Rishikesh, the Advanced course, Teachers Training and the Art Excel courses came to an end amidst lot of jubilation...!!! Lots of healing experiences were shared. The last days, Satsang was graced by the Saints from the neighbouring Ashrams. From Rishikesh, Guruji and the entourage left for Chandigarh. The trip was full of Sri Sri's mischief. On the way, the entourage stopped at the Sikh holy shrine - Paonta Sahib. An enthusiastic Chadigarh team received the entourage past midnight. More than seven thousand people were totally enraptured at the Satsang on the following day. On to Shimla.......
