[2/22/25, 1:13:37 AM] ~ Dady: A Fight for Life: The Story of a Teacher Who Chose Change Over Comfort

In a world driven by ambition and financial security, one man made an extraordinary choice—he left behind a high-paying corporate job to dedicate his life to education and social reform. He believed that true change begins in the classroom, and he poured his heart into shaping young minds.

But fate had other plans. In March 2024, at the age of 44, he was diagnosed with cancer. What followed was a grueling battle—a series of treatments, including proton radiation and chemotherapy, pushing both his body and finances to the limit. The total cost of his treatment reached nearly ₹20 lakhs, with ₹17.5 lakhs spent at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.

Then came February 7, 2025—the day of his final surgery to remove the last traces of cancer. A transoral open surgery was performed, a complex procedure that required opening the palate of his mouth. Despite stitches being given, the wound has now reopened, leaving his mouth, throat, and nasal areas torn and exposed. The condition is dire, and immediate reconstruction surgery is essential.

The surgery is estimated to cost ₹5 lakhs. So far, ₹3 lakhs has been arranged, but ₹2 lakhs is urgently needed. With no earnings for the past year and only a ₹2,000 per month income certificate from the Kolkata collector, the financial burden is overwhelming. His past employer has officially declared him "No Longer Employed," and while he has managed to get a ration card, survival is becoming increasingly difficult.

This is more than just a story of illness—it's a testament to resilience, sacrifice, and the unwavering spirit of a man who gave up personal gain to serve society. Now, he needs support to continue his fight.

[2/24/25, 12:39:14 PM] ~ Dady: Nope
[2/24/25, 12:39:20 PM] ~ Dady: It must be said that, by God's grace, Abhijnan was recovering very well after radiation, chemotherapy, Sudarshan Kriya, and a healthy diet. At Tata Memorial Hospital, doctors stated that a surgery was necessary to remove the tumor along with a safe margin in the nasopharynx.

However, during the procedure, Tata Memorial surgeons perforated the upper palate inside his mouth. Just five days after the surgery, the stitches came undone. Since then, Abhijnan's health has deteriorated severely—he lost 16 kg in just 10 days. The gap inside his mouth started expanding exponentially. Despite repeated requests, Tata Memorial refused to restitch the area.

Meanwhile, he developed infections and clots inside his nasal passage and lungs. His entire mouth was affected by fistulas, and the upper palate began tearing progressively. Even at this critical stage, Tata Memorial took no action.

Seeing no other option, we urgently reached out to another hospital, where doctors confirmed that Abhijnan needed two major reconstructive surgeries immediately—without which saving his life would be impossible.
