Politics

Don't let politics sway you away from the path. If you are afraid of politics you cannot be successful in the spiritual realm. You have to cross the barricade of politics. It is the test of your strength, commitment, and your focus. You cannot avoid politics, but to harbor it in your mind or not, is your choice. There were politics among the 12 apostles, and with Buddha. And Krishna was in politics from head to toe. And you say you don't want politics? The more you don't want it, the more you will harbor it in your consciousness. When you recognize politics in any group or Satsang, that is a blessing for you to be centered and go inward. You can do that without blaming the group and running away from people, or chickening out. It can enhance your skill to act and not get attached.

Advantages of politics:

-- Brings up diversity in people.

-- Puts in front of you different viewpoints, ways, and tendencies.

-- Enhances your skill to communicate and act.

-- Brings centeredness and dispassion.

-- Shakes you up and makes you stand up to the knowledge.

-- Enhances your capacity to accept and tolerate.

-- Makes you realize the whole life is a game.

Cross the threshold of politics and come to the Divine.

The strong will smile through the politics and the weak will lament.
