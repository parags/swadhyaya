TECHNOLOGY

The purpose of technology is to harness nature to bring information and comfort to human beings. When spiritual values - human values - are ignored and

neglected, instead of bringing comfort, technology brings fear and destruction.

Technology without human values would see nature as a dead object. Science gives an insight into the life of nature and spirituality makes the nature come alive.

For example, in the eyes of children, there is nothing dead in the world - animals, trees, the sun and the moon - they all have life, they all have emotions, they all have feelingsÅ‰n the eyes of a stressed and ignorant person, even human beings are like robots - objects!

Technology without spirituality is destructive. Spirituality is the technology of consciousness, and the whole world is the play and display of consciousness.

NEWS FLASH

The first Basic Course was held in Kosovo.

The Bangalore Ashram has 250 enthusiasts in Teacher Training.

Every inch of the German Ashram is filled with smiling faces.

Guruji was welcomed with much fanfare at the Indian Pavilion at Expo 2000 in Hannover with the traditional Aarti and a Manipuri dance. From there he

walked through the Avenue of Trees, with devotees sprinkling rose-petals in his path, to the Christ Pavilion where he was welcomed by African drummers. Against the melodious strains of a harp, he held a powerful meditation and spoke on the theme of the Expo: Humankind-Nature-Technology. The depth of silence was felt even in the prayer service, which ended with Guruji being taken ceremoniously to sign at the special gallery - the glass facade of the church!

Jai Guru Dev
