HOW TO DEAL WITH HUMILIATION?

Know that humiliation does not weaken you -- it strengthens you.

When you have a sense of belongingness, you don't feel humiliated. The more egotistic you are, the more humiliation you feel. When you are childlike and have a greater sense of kinship then you don't feel humiliated.

When you are committed to truth and not to your ego then you also don't feel humiliated.

If you are afraid of humiliation, you can neither make progress in your material life nor in your spiritual life. When you stand above humiliation, you get closer to the Self - to God. When you are steeped in love, with the Existence, with the Divine, nothing whatsoever can humiliate you.

So, the way out of humiliation is:

Get humiliated!

Be childlike

Be crazy

Get steeped in love with the Divine

Total commitment to Truth-Knowledge

 

NEWS FLASH

This begins the sixth year of knowledge sheets.

There was an advanced course of 115 people and a TTC course with 70 people at the Bakal ashram in Siberia. DSN courses in Europe are keeping everyone on a high.

As people poured into the Quebec Ashram to join Guruji for the summer programs, there was no space left. Not even for the mosquitoes.

Jai Guru Dev
