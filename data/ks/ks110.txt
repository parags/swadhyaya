LET LOVE BE

Let love be. Don't give it a name. When you give it a name it becomes a relationship, and relationship restricts love.

There is love between you and me. Just let it be. If you name love, for example, brother, sister, mother, father, guru, you are making it into a relationship. Relationship restricts love. Let love be. DonÒ´ give it a name.

What is your relationship to yourself? Are you your wife, brother, husband, guru?

NEWS FLASH

During the last two days at the Montreal Ashram, Guruji and crew went to a Waterfall for a swim. Guruji said from underneath the Waterfall, "If the course didn't help you become silent, then come sit under the Waterfall."

The party moved to California where at the Agape Church the audience became participants and sang, "Hoya Heya!!"

Meetings with leaders from the Black community have gone well and the phone is ringing off the hook as people from all over the world prepare to gather for Guru Purnima at Lake Tahoe.

Jai Guru Dev
