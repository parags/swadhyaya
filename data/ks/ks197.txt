YOU AND YOUR TIME

When you feel time is too short, you are either restless or in expanded awareness. When you feel time is too long, you are miserable or keen minded. When you are happy and love what you are doing, you simply don't feel the time. Also, in sleep you don't feel the time.

In deep meditation, you are the time and everything is happening in you. Events are happening in you like the clouds come and go in the sky.

When you are ahead of time, it is dragging and boring. When the time is ahead of you, then you are surprised and shocked. You cannot digest the events.

When you are with the time, you are wise and at peace.

Narayana Sharma says, "Guruji, you spend a good time with us!"

Next week we will see how to manage time or how the time manages us.
