GOD IS A THOROUGH BUSINESSMAN

The Divine has given you all the small pleasures in the world, but has kept the bliss to Himself. To get the highest bliss you have to go to Him and Him alone.

Don't be too smart with the Divine and try to fool Him. Most of your prayers and rituals are just attempts to trick the Divine. You try to give the least and get the maximum out of the Divine and He knows. He's an astute businessman; He will trick you even more. If you go underneath the carpet, He will go underneath the floor.

Be sincere in your attempts. Do not try to outsmart the Divine. Once you get the bliss, then everything else is joyful. Without the bliss, joy in anything in the world will not stay.

 NEWS FLASH:

 We emerged from silence to celebrate at the lake the fifth anniversary of the Ashram. It was like a fairytale with the full moon rising above the trees, the sounds of Susannah's and Phillip's flutes, fireworks, and bonfires. The Guru took us spinning in circles on a raft and to our surprise brought us back to the same shore. In the confusion, we forgot to serve the anniversary cake.

 After the Montreal talk, Denise drove off with Guruji in the car with all the doors open. Ramola ran from behind and jumped in. In the fever to get into the Guru's car, somebody left luggage behind, another left a purse, another left their shoes, and they all left their minds.

 Guruji and Phillip have just left for Toronto and then are to go to Colorado.

 On the 14th of July an Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference will be sponsored by the Art of Living in Washington DC. Ten Swamis from India have been invited.

 Thomas called Punditji to tell him that a forest fire raging at Lake Tahoe which burned many million dollar houses, came up to his property, burned his tool shed, but stopped at his front door. Neither his home -- where many Satsangs had been held -- nor his garden were damaged.

Jai Guru Dev
