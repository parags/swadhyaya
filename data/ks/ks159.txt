GENEROSITY IS THE QUALITY OF THE SPIRIT

When You Feel Stuck In Life And Not Growing, Bombarded By Desires, When There Is Dryness, Lack Of enthusiasm, no juice, what do you do?

Here is the solution....FEEL GENEROUS....right away, not tomorrow.

Either a princess or a pauper can feel generous. Generosity is the quality of the spirit. When you feel generous your life becomes abundant, full of compassion and love.

Question: Is generosity the same as being grateful?

Answer: No. Gratefulness always has self concern. You are grateful because you have something or you get something. Generosity is an expression independent of external circumstances. No one can make you feel generous. That is something that you have to do yourself. Essentially, generosity is not an act. It is a state of consciousness, but it cannot but find its expression in an act.

Question: What about passion?

Answer: Passion indicates scarcity. Dispassion is abundance. Dispassion without generosity makes you self-centered, causes more dryness.

You dontÂ´ have to think about what you have done in the past. That only brings doership.

Just feel generous.

NEWS FLASH Following Guruj's visit to South Africa, there is now a very successful prison program going on.

The North American tour started to heat up as Guruji came to Chicago for more inspiring talks and intimate Satsangs. The knowledge flowed as each devotee felt Guruji was speaking only to them. There is no independent consciousness. In Jackson Hole, Wyoming the weather cooled but the volunteers were still hot arranging standing room only talks and quiet walks by pristine lakes. Then on to Vancouver where Guruji was again met by sunshine in the skies and on the faces of devotees.
