Softness And Forcefulness

Certain types of people are soft and their softness comes out of lack of courage and forcefulness. There is yet another type of softness in people and this softness comes out of maturity, magnanimity, and the knowledge of the Self.

The people who are soft out of lack of courage suffer a lot. And sometime or other they become volatile.

Similarly there are two types of forcefulness in people Ã– aggression or assertiveness. Some people are forceful in an aggressive manner out of weakness, lack of strength, or out of fear. Others are forceful out of care and love, out of compassion.

David: Aggressive control and aggressive support.

Guruji: So look into yourself and become aware of what type of softness and what type of forcefulness you have.

NEWS FLASH: There were spring and cherry blossoms in the German ashram and as Guruji came, snow also came. Three new countries joined the Art of Living map this month: Bulgaria, Namibia, and the Dominican Republic

Jai Guru Dev
