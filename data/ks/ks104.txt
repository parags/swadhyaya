Weekly Knowledge #104	Bus on the Tour-de-France
03 Jun 1997	France
THE DIVINE BEYOND TIME

An ignorant person either disbelieves or believes the individual. The wise neither disbelieves nor believes the individual. His faith rests on Kala (time). When the time is good, a foe will behave like a friend. When the time is not good, even a friend will behave like a foe. The wiser one believes in Mahakala (the Grand time or Shiva). An ignorant person disbelieves in time and the Divine beyond time.

In the world and in time there is always room for improvement. You can improve your time and your nature. Only the Being is perfect all the time. Take refuge in the Being and become incorrigible.

"I am" incorrigible.

NEWS FLASH:

The discovery of the week is that Guruji has a three piece suit and a mobile phone! Guruji always has a three piece suit (Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh) and only one suit case!

The miracle of the week is that the angry, reluctant and uncooperative driver of the "Tour de France" bus has become friendly and very patient with the Art of Living circus. A big transformation has occurred in him by just being with the group. Now he believes that Guruji is more successful than president Chirac.

His only puzzle was that whatever Guruji said was so correct, yet the people in the bus were so different.

The joke of the week is that by the end of the tour, he started serving us to such an extent that he forgot his own baggage. The Tour de France gave a big boost to the AoL France. The advanced course has begun in a beautiful Zen temple.

Jai Guru Dev
