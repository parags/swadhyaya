Wake up and Transcend

The foolish one uses the spiritual power to gain material comfort.

An intelligent one uses the material world to rise high in the spirit.

When you transcend the intellect you allow yourself to be used by the spirit.

One who is awake neither uses anything nor loses anything.

Become intelligent, transcend and wake up.
