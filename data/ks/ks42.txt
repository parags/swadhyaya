BLAMING AND MISERY

When a worldly man is miserable, he blames the people around him, the system, and the world in general.

When a seeker is miserable he, of course, blames the world, but in addition he blames the path, the Knowledge, and himself.

It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker (sadhak) also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater. A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. Do you see what I am saying?

It is like a quantum leap. If one jumps across this threshold then there is no fall.

The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance.

Who will test? One who does not know will test, isn't it? God knows your capacity, so why does he have to test you? Then, why the misery? It is thithiksha, or forbearance, in you. And forbearance could be increased by prayerful surrender or vigorous challenge for patience! (Laughter)

News:

 Picnic to Neelkant hills and holy Haridwar was a grand finale to the Rishikesh course, followed by a wild Satsang in New Delhi. It was so charged! Guruji is back in the Ashram for a quiet three days before his Australian tour.

 From U.K.: Guruji had given a rose to a lady on February 13 and they called to say that the flower was still amazingly fresh and fragrant after six weeks! This miracle inspired an otherwise unwilling lady to do the course.

 Important exercise: Find out what it is that has been with you forever. Belma says that she asked herself this question 20 years ago and she knows all the answers. And that there is only one answer . . . . (Laughter)

 

Jai Guru Dev
