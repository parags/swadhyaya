Tarka, Vitarka And Kutarka

To know yourself or to judge your actions you need to know Tarka, Vitarka and Kutarka.

Kutarka is wrong logic. Most people apply this logic and get caught up in ignorance. For example : The door is half open means the door is half closed. Therefore, the door is fully open means the door is fully closed!

Or: God is Love. Love is Blind. Therefore, God is Blind!!!

Tarka is sequential logical understanding; it increases scientific knowledge. When sequential logical understanding changes, then scientific conclusions change. For example: Pesticides and antibiotics were considered to be very useful in the past, and are now proven to be more harmful. In tarka, the paradigm changes.

Vitarka is asking questions to which there are no evident answers....Who am I? Where am I? What do I really want? These philosophically appealing questions bring forth spiritual knowledge, increase your awareness and bring about the blossoming of Consciousness, i.e., Atma Gyan increases.

The wise know to distinguish between the three. They will not apply kutarka or tarka for vitarka, and vitarka for tarka.

NEWS FLASH: The Commissioner of Human Rights in Assam received Sri Sri in Guwahati. That evening there was a jubilant satsang. The devotees went on a picnic with Sri Sri to a hilltop on the banks of the Brahmaputra River.

The next day Sri Sri arrived in Calcutta where the Ganguly house was transformed into a dreamland with magical decorations. On the same day, he addressed the Calcutta Management Association. The following day, he enlightened an elite group of ambassadors, officials and politicians on Face to Face - a television program. 8000 people attended the Grand Satsang at Calcutta. Sri Sri spoke very little, but left everybody with a happy smile.

Sri Sri's black bag was lost and found miraculously after a week!!! Easter Advanced Courses are happening all over the world.

Jai Guru Dev
