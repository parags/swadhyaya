WHAT ENHANCES YOUR BEAUTY?

 

When your mind is not complaining, responsible, courageous, confident and hollow and empty you are inexplicably beautiful. A person who cannot correct or act has no right to complain. And when a person can correct or act, he will never complain. Complaining is a sign of weakness. Complaining is the nature of utter ignorance where one does not know the Self. Complaint takes away the Beauty that is inborn in you. And it shows up more on the one who is on this path.

Worldly mind is a complaining mind; Divine mind is a dancing mind. Just complaining without indicating the solution is irresponsibility. When the solutions are not workable, finding alternative solutions is Courage.

For external beauty, you put on things; for real Beauty, you have to drop all the things. For external beauty you have to have Make-up; for your real Beauty you only have to realise that you are MADE-UP!

NEWS FLASH:

Public Satsangs were thronged by thousands and cable networks broadcast it live. Construction activities and an ART Excel course for children are in full swing. Home for the homeless and sanitation facilities for the surrounding villages is the new Seva Project started by Guruji. Already 15 houses are coming up fast.

Those who are living in the present and who tell others to live in the present are busy planning. But the plans of the Singaporeans were toppled by Guruji by not arriving there as scheduled. What a Game!!!

This weeks Knowledge Sheet ended with a cooooooool splash from Guruji's water-bottle.

Jai Guru Dev
