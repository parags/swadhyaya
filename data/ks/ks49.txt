SELF

 Self is not just the mind-body complex. Often people think of the Self as the mind-body complex. This is an erroneous notion. Neither the body nor the mind is the Self. All the yoga you do is for the body. All the meditation you do is for the mind.

 Whether calm or disturbed, your mind remains mind.

Whether sick or well, your body remains body.

Self is all-encompassing.

  Service without attitude

Love without reason

Knowledge without intellect

Life beyond time and events

Is what you are.

 The only purpose for this body to exist is to make you aware of how beautiful you are, and to make you aware that it is possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you.

  

NEWS FLASH:

 There is a star named after Guruji. Thanks to Jody, the international Star Registry has named a star "Sri Sri Ravishankar."

 The Ashram was specially lit up to match the smiles of about a thousand devotees from all over. Tents were pitched for people. Thanks to the excellent organizing and the volunteers who made everyone feel very special and taken care of. Belma says it was not chaos as expected!

 The sacred Vedic chants in the morning air, the elaborate afternoon meal, laughter and dancing in the evening were all simply magical. Everyone danced with candles in their hands and Sumeru Mantap looked like a festive cake.

 The third advanced course has begun.

 

Jai Guru Dev
