 MISTAKES

Mistakes keep happening all the time. Often you get irritated by them and want to correct them. How much can you correct?  There are two situations when you correct other’s mistakes:

1. You correct someone’s mistake because it bothers you. But even if you correct it, this does not work.

2. You correct someone’s mistake, not because it bothers you, but for their sake so that they can grow.

To correct mistakes you need authority and love. Authority and love seem to be contradictory, but in reality they are not. Authority without love is stifling and does not work. Love without authority is shallow. A friend needs to have both authority and love but they need to be in the right combination. This can happen if you are totally dispassionate and centered. 

When you allow room for mistakes, you can be both authoritative and sweet. That is how the Divine is, the right balance of both. Krishna and Jesus had both. People, when they are in love, exercise authority with each other. Authority and love exist in all relationships.

 

Abhay says, "The husband just loves and the wife has authority."

Mikey asks, "Is that a mistake?"

Guruji says, "I don’t want to correct it!" (laughter)

News Flash:

Guruji was resplendent rafting down the river with all the course participants following and chanting bhajans.

 

Jai Guru Dev
