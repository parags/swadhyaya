Communism and Spirituality

Communism has three goals.

To check the greed of feudal and capitalistic societies.
To check the fanaticism and fundamentalism of religious communities.
To care for and share with the needy.
Only spirituality can bring fulfillment to communism.
Only spirituality can check greed and open up the hearts of the rich to help the needy.
Only spirituality can check the fanaticism and fundamentalism of religious groups and create a sense of belongingness in the whole world.
Only spirituality brings up the tendency to care and share in oneâ€™s life.
Only spirituality can bring about open mindedness and a progressive attitude.

Communism cannot fulfill its goals without spirituality. It is impossible and time has proved it. Spirituality nourishes communism.

Knowledge Nibble!

Question: If you have a Guru do you need luck?
Sri Sri: You need luck to have a Guru! (Laughter)

 News Flash:

Guruji was in Sikkim for a huge Satsang. He later visited the Rumtek monastery where he was given a traditional Buddhist welcome. Calcutta saw thousands thronging the largest stadium in the city for a rousing Satsang and deep rejuvenating meditation with Guruji.

For the first time, 700 people boarded the Enlightenment Express from Mumbai to Bangalore for a wonderful Advanced Course with Guruji.

Jai Guru Dev
