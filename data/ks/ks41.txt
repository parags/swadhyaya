QUESTIONS

 A boy asked a question and before Guruji could answer, he was ready with another question.

 To this Guruji said, "If you hold onto the question how will you receive the answer? Give away the question to me and then you will find that you are in the answer. If your hands are holding onto the question, how will you receive the answer? Your hands are already full with the question."

 

 NEWS FLASH

 Guruji is still in Rishikesh. 350 people arrived from all over India for the advanced course -- a hundred more than expected. The volunteers had to run around trying to arrange rooms in the ashrams. During Satsang, the hall was spilling over with participants whose faces radiated ecstasy in the presence of the Master.

 It appeared that all the Gods from heaven came down to earth to the holy town of Rishikesh to bask in the glory of the Master. The powerful Himalayas and the divine Ganges echo the sounds of joy and the laughter of the devotees.

 Today is Gudi Padwa and Ugadi --- the new year celebrated in many parts of India. All 350 devotees went for a dip in the holy Ganges at 4:30 a.m. with Guruji oblivious to the temperature of the river. This was a new start to the new year in the presence of the Divine.

 The most renowned, 75-year old saint of Rishikesh, Swami Pragyanandji had a vision in which he saw Guruji as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh with many arms. He then performed a puja to Guruji.

 

Jai Guru Dev
