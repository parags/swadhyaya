ENLIGHTENMENT

 Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree.

 Sometimes the question comes up "What's the use of all these courses? Your behavior has not changed!"

 The Knowledge acquired by a human being cannot be measured or judged by external behavior. Someone may behave as though they have absorbed all the Knowledge but internally they have not. The reverse is also true. Someone who seems to have not changed at all may have absorbed a lot.

 Ordinary people would just look at the behavior, but the intelligent looks beyond and is amazed by the play of the consciousness (Brahman).

  Behavior affects relationships

Attitude affects behavior

Knowledge or ignorance affects attitude

Grace brings forth Knowledge.

Your inside is like a tree; in some seasons barren and at other times blossomed. Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree which yields throughout the year.

NEWS FLASH:

 The third advanced course (in Tamil) not only melted the hearts but also a gallstone of a participant! Many more healing experiences were reported -- like the minds, blocked arteries also opened. Guruji held the rains for almost an hour as an intense Satsang was underway in Sumeru Mandap.

 Guruji is presiding over a big conference for Awakening the Society organized by several spiritual heads in the state before he takes off for a rendezvous in Paris.

 

Jai Guru Dev
