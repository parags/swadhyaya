THE BIG DILEMMA

If there is complete faith, then there are no questions. If you don't have any faith then there is no point in asking any questions because how can there be any faith in the answer that is given?

Harish : What About The Questions That We Ask With Complete Faith?

Sri Sri : If you have faith in God or yourself or your family and friends then questions cannot arise. When you know somebody is taking care of you, what is the need to ask any question? For example, if you have taken the Karnataka Express to Bangalore, then there is no need to ask at every station "Where is the train going?". When there is someone to take care of your desire, then why go to an astrologer?

Rajesh : But what about blind faith?

Sri Sri : Faith is faith...it cannot be blind. When you call it blind it is not faith - at least not yours! Blindness and faith cannot meet. It is when you lose faith, you become blind.

NEWS FLASH The Swamis (Saints) from Adichunchungiri Mutt, arrived in our German Ashram. There was a grand Satsang on Friday night and a picnic to the nearby water fall on Sunday. Next stop - Mumbai.

More than four thousand people filled up a beautiful hall for a fabulous Satsang and a fantastic meditation led by Sri Sri. The sound system which had hiccups(!!) miraculously delivered crystal clear sound whenever Sri Sri spoke. This is being written on the way to a sudden Satsang attended by 600 people after which Sri Sri returns to the Bangalore HQ.

Jai Guru Dev
