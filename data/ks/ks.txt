THIS BEGINS A NEW PRACTICE

This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995.

* * * *

Beyond an event is Knowledge.

Beyond a person is love.

Beyond an object is infinity.

Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event.

If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.

When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.

What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.

When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!

Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.

The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.

Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.

CLOSE TO THE MASTER

If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself.

Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.

If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.

Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?

Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.

Question: Can we call you every week?

Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.

Answer: Yes, put that in. (Laughter)

You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.

PRABDHA KARMA AND SANCHITA KARMA

Some karma can be changed and some cannot.

When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.

If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.

Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.

When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.

Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.

ONLY SPEAK KNOWLEDGE

Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- "That so-and-so said such-and-such about you." If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it.

If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile.

Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort.

When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self.

God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.

People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?

In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?

Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.

MASTER IS A DOORWAY

Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.

Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door.

But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, "If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?" or "How would she handle it?" "If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?" "If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.

The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter.

From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donÒ´ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.

All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.

But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, "Oh, he looked at me." "He didn't look at me." "Oh, he said this." "He didn't say that." "Oh, somebody is close. I am not close." All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.

Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life.

DOUBT

A doubt is a gray area. Gray is something which is neither white nor black. Now, how to solve the doubt? An event, knowledge, convention cannot help. Then what can help? Accepting it either as black or as white. Put it either as black and accept it or as white and accept it -- whether or not it is black or white. And see the gray as a shade of black or white. Either way you accept it. Honest or dishonest -- accept it. Then the mind is quiet. You are not in the gray area.

See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.

Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. "I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me." That's it. Finished.

Doubt is wanting to get rid of something. Doubt is a temporary state. Neither up nor below. There tension arises.

FIRE

 The senses are like fire. Your life is also like fire. In the fire of senses, whatever you put in burns. If you burn tires, it creates pollution and bad smell. But if you burn sandalwood, it creates fragrance.

 Celebration happens around the bonfire. Grief happens around the fire of cremation. The same fire that supports life in winter, can also destroy. One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution.

 You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.

 The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It is samyama that transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discuss samyama.

HABITS AND VOWS

 How to get rid of vasanas (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits.

 You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature of vasana is to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.

 The way to come out of habits is vows. This is samyama. Everybody is endowed with a little samyama.

 A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.

 When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress.

 The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity for samyama and feel happy about it. Without samyama, life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.

 Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits through samyama.

 Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, "I will quit smoking," but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.

 All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, in samyama. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain in samyama.

DEALING WITH BLAME

 When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. "Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away." And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying?

 So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, "Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma," you will feel immediately lighter.

 How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, "Don't blame me because it hurts me."

 An enlightened person also says "Don't blame me." Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.

 An ignorant person warns you, "You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt." Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.

 An enlightened person says "Don't blame me because it will hurt you." So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.

  

 News:

 Guruji arrived in Poland for an enchanting course with nearly 400 people. Every eye was filled with tears of gratitude. Then Guruji was off to Braunlage in Germany where more than 200 people had come together to celebrate the silence.

TODAY IS KRISHNA'S BIRTHDAY

BIRTH OF THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION

 Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.

 Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.

 The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, "I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise." In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.

 Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he is Anasuya. Next week we will see what is Anasuya.

ANASUYA

 Knowledge will be different at different levels of consciousness. At a particular level of consciousness you will become anasuya. Anasuya is devoid of fault-finding eyes. If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.

 There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he is anasuya. "You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close."

 From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not in anasuya, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge.

 Question: What about discrimination -- Wisdom?

 Answer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is not anasuya. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is not anasuya.

 However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, "My vision is blurred," you say, "The whole world is not sharp." Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This is asuya. It is not anasuya. Most of the population is like this.

 Asuya is finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, "Mother, you don't love me!" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, "Guruji, you don't love me!" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.

 Question: It seems as though you can't have anasuya unless you are enlightened?

 Answer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.

THE LOVE OF THE IGNORANT AND THE ANGER OF THE ENLIGHTENED

 The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!

 An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."

 The mother says, "Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok." She thinks, "No child in the world is like my child." And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, "Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely." So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, "Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend." The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.

 The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in the Puranas. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.

 The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!

 The Master said, "It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults."

 The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!

A LIAR IS INNOCENT

 A dear person whom you trust lies to you and gets caught. What do you feel?

1. Sadness

2. Anger

3. Cheated

4. Disappointment

5. Compassion

6. Let down

7. Loss of respect

8. Wonder

9. Shock

10. Embarrassment

Recently when someone lied to me, I felt happy and more love, for they were not a good liar. Had they been a good liar, they would not have been caught. I thought they were so innocent that they could not even lie properly. They lie and get caught. If they had not been caught, how would you know they were a liar? So . . . you can never know a good liar. The person you call a liar is not a good liar and they are innocent. Aren't they?

And so . . . ha ha (laugh). You need not go through all the listed mental gymnastics. Instead melt and dissolve in Love.

BE A GOPAL

 Like fish in the water, you are in air. Thoughts are in mind. Mind is in Big Mind. The Big Mind in Me is love. Emotions are ripples in love. Love is all Knowledge.

 Every atom of Big Mind is crammed with Knowledge. Knowing this, you stop seeking. You seek until you come to the Master. You walk until you come to the swimming pool. You don't walk or run in the swimming pool -- you swim or float. Once you come to the Master, seeking stops, blossoming begins.

 You are Knowledge. Every atom in you is shimmering with Knowledge. This is called Go. Be a Go-Pal. Be a friend in Knowledge.

 Go has four meanings:

Knowledge

Movement

Achievement

Freedom or liberation

Pal means friend or protector -- one who takes care of.

Often you become friends by:

Gossiping about negative things

Complaining

Similar cravings or aversions

Common enemies or common problems

Common goals or common addictions

Coming together in Knowledge is rare. You become friends because you have something in common. Be a friend in Knowledge. Uplift each other in Knowledge. All Satsangees are Gopals -- reminding each other, coming together in and for Knowledge. That is Gopal. Be a protector of this Knowledge.

BIG MIND

 You know there is a Big Mind and a small mind. Sometimes the Big Mind wins over the small mind and sometimes it is the other way around.

 When the small mind wins over, it is misery and when the Big Mind wins, it is joy.

 Small mind promises joy and leaves your hand empty. Big Mind may bring resistance in the beginning but fills you with joy.

 The word Guru means great. Jaya means victory. Deva means one who is fun-loving, playful, light. One who is playful is often not dignified and when one is dignified, he is often not playful.

Jai Guru Dev is victory to the Big Mind in you that is both dignified and playful. That is what Jai Guru Dev means: "Victory to the Greatness in you."

You do not say victory or hail to the Master as he has won over already. You say victory to your own Self, your own Mind, which is being veiled by the small mind.

THE ONLY THING YOU MUST REMEMBER

 

The only thing you must remember is

how fortunate you are.

 When you forget this you become sad. Sorrow indicates

(I) your negative qualities, and (ii) your attachment to your positive qualities. When you think you are too good, you blame the world; then you become sad. The purpose of sorrow is to bring you back to the self. And self is all Joy. But this is possible only through Knowledge -- awareness.

 Knowledge or awareness leads sorrow towards the self. With lack of Knowledge, the same sorrow multiplies and does not get completed. Knowledge completes sorrow.

 With the power of Knowledge you transcend sorrow. In this path you have everything. We have this beautiful Knowledge which has all the flavors in it -- wisdom, laughter, seva, silence, singing, dancing, humor, celebration, yagyas, caring, complaints, problems, complications, and chaos to add color.

 Life is so colorful!

FREEDOM AND DISCIPLINE

Freedom and discipline are opposites and complementary. The purpose of defense is to protect freedom. But is there freedom in defense? Do soldiers have freedom? No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?

Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.

Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.

There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.

Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.

On this path Knowledge is your Freedom
and also your Defense.

DISCIPLESHIP ENDS --

A SHISHYA (DISCIPLE) OR

A SAKHA (COMPANION)?

 Knowledge has an end. Knowledge completes. So also does discipleship. For the disciple is aimed at acquiring Knowledge.

 Once you cross the water, however nice the boat is, you get off the boat. After twelve years, the disciple completes his studies. The master does a ceremony called Samavartha, where he tells the disciple that he is ending the discipleship and asking him to behave at par with him, and let the Brahman dynamically manifest.

 Sakha is a companion in life and death; it never ends. In the path of love there is neither beginning nor end. Sakha only wants the beloved. He doesn't care about the Knowledge or liberation. Love is incomplete because of longing. And so it is infinite, for infinity can never be complete.

 Arjuna was a sakha to Krishna and although Krishna was the perfect Master he was a sakha, too. What are you, a shishya (disciple) or a sakha (companion)?

SAKHA -- YOUR RELIABLE SENSE

 There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words: sukha, pleasure; dukha, sorrow; and sakha, companion. These have one thing in common: "kha," which means "senses."

 The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (sukha), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (dukha) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close.

Self      ---      Senses ("Kha")     ---      World

---     Joy (Sukha)           Sorrow (Dukha)     ---

Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. So sukha is that which takes you to the Self. Dukha is that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self.

All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self.

Sa-kha, companion, means: "He is the senses." Sakha is one who has become your senses, who is your senses. If you are my senses, it means I get Knowledge through you; you are my sixth sense. As I trust my mind, so I trust you. A friend could be just an object of the senses, but a sakha has become the very senses.

The sakha is the companion who is there in both the experiences of the dukha and of sukha. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self is sakha.

Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. So sakha means, "He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him."

If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity.

Your head will be in the mud in a few years;

Don't put mud in your head while you are still alive.

SCEPTICISM

 Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. So, in reality, you can never know whether you are a sceptic or not!

 A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed.

 A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence.

 In short, scepticism is an "I know it all" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing.

 In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism.

 Do not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism.

 Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight.

 Scepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities. Their world is one of innocence, joy, beauty, and so much love.

SHAUCHA AND ASHAUCHA

 When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called Ashaucha. It means you have become unclean.

 In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be Ashaucha for 10 days because they are very sad. They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called Shaucha. They have purged out the impurities that have come during events.

 This keeps happening again and again in dealings in life. You become Ashaucha and you have to get back to Shaucha. Go deeper in to yourself, then real Shaucha happens.

 Shaucha's benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self.

 Shaucha is disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, "Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again." Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes.

Why do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight? Ashaucha has happened. If you don't get distaste for the tendency of the senses then distaste for the object of the senses will come and you will blame the object.

 When Ashaucha happens then come back to Shaucha quickly. Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this is Ashaucha . . . "That is why I am suffering misery." Then come back to Shaucha.

 Your attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is "other." When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them.

 When you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.

BOREDOM AND SADHANA

 What is boredom?

 A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self.

 A practice or abhyasa is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. In this process the practice itself creates boredom and as you continue, it penetrates the boredom and destroys it once and for all. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Only the practice or abhyasa can annihilate the Mind.

 Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. That is why love letters are simply repetitive and there is no boredom there. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.

 Wake up and Walk up.

WHO ARE YOU? BRAHMA, VISHNU, MAHESH OR GURU?

 There are three forces: Brahma shakti, Vishnu shakti, and Shiva shakti. You may have one of these predominant. Brahma shakti is the force to create something new. Vishnu shakti is maintenance and Shiva shakti is bringing in transformation, filling in life, or destroying.

 Some of you have Brahma shakti. You may create well, but you may not be able to maintain. For example, you may make friends very fast, but it does not last long.

 There are others who cannot create but are good at maintaining. For example, people have long lasting friendships but cannot make any new friends. In such cases, Vishnu shakti is dominant.

 And then there are others who have more of Shiva shakti. They bring in new life or transformation or they can destroy the whole set up.

 In Guru shakti, all three shaktis have blossomed fully.

 So each of you first identify which shakti you have more of and aspire for Guru shakti. Guru makes a group but a group cannot make a Guru.

HOW TO MAINTAIN INTIMACY

 Intimacy often gets broken because of ego or your desire. What breaks intimacy?

Ego or taking a position

Desire

Taking intimacy for granted

Finding imperfection in oneself or others

Expectations

Insensitivity or over sensitivity

Lack of vivek or vairagya (lack of discretion or dispassion)

Judgements

Grumbling or lack of gratitude

Dissolving into infinity is the way to maintain intimacy. Intimacy is dissolving into infinity. Dissolving into infinity brings you to the moment. Go beyond events. Dissolve into infinity, be in the moment, and look beyond the events. This is the way to maintain intimacy.

* * * *

If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Just to maintain where you are, what you are, you need to attend weekly Satsang.

 Now, start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone. You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: "What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?" Praise the Divine.

 This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge. Say, "Everything is temporary, everything is changing." Speak some Knowledge on the changing nature of the world.

ALL ARE SEARCHING FOR SWEETS,

THE ONE WHO FINDS THEM,

GIVES THEM AWAY

 

Guruji was on the porch with a group of people. He sent Kashi to get the sweets from inside the kuti, but Kashi returned saying he could not find them. He went again and again, three times, and still he could not find them. Then Guruji himself went in. He came out with the sweets and gave them to everyone.

 This is exactly what happens in life. Many want sweetness in life. Some are searching hard, but only one finds it. And when that one finds it, he gives it to everyone.

 Everyone is blissed in and some are blissed out, too!

OVERCOMING EVENTS

 All the problems that you face in life are because you attach over importance to the events. The events grow bigger while you remain smaller. Say, for example, you are riding a motorbike on a busy motor way and in front of you there is another vehicle emitting exhaust fumes. You have three options.

 

1. You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.

2. You can slow down or wait for some time to allow the vehicle to move far away from you.

3. You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.

As in the first case, most of you stick on the events and are miserable, like inhaling fumes throughout your journey.

In the second case, you don't get permanent relief, as another bigger vehicle might come in front of you. Like that, running away from events is not the permanent solution.

However, wise people use their skill and grow over the events. If the vehicle is in perfect condition, the skill is effective. Conditioning the vehicle is sadhana or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru.

The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.

THE WASHING MACHINE

 Our body is like a washing machine, our mind is like cloth, each lifetime is one run or cycle, and Knowledge is detergent. The mind comes into the body to get cleansed and pure. But instead of detergent, if you use dirt, then you have dirty clothes.

 Pure water is like love, Knowledge is like detergent, mind is like cloth, and the body like the washing machine. If you put in mud instead of detergent, your clothes become dirtier than before.

 You will have to go on putting clothes in the washing machine to get them cleaned. And the process repeats again and again. Similarly you will have many more births until you stop repeating the mistakes that you have made.

DIVINE IS ALL CELEBRATION

 A poor man celebrates the new year once a year. A rich man celebrates each day. But the richest man celebrates every moment.

 How rich are you? Do you celebrate once a year? Once a month? Every day? If you celebrate every moment, you are the Lord of Creation.

 Review the year while you celebrate. This is your homework. What did you do? What did you achieve? How useful were you this past year? Sit for an hour and think about every week, one minute per week, and see the year's growth in less than an hour. With a flower, on New Year's Day, offer the whole year to the Divine.

 

 

SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE

 During Satsang, Guruji opened a small nicely-wrapped present. It was a tiny bottle of jasmine perfume. He twisted off the cap and sniffed the lovely fragrance. Then he proceeded to pour a small amount on some paper which he waved in the air, wafting the scent to all corners of the hall. Everyone could then enjoy it.

 Guruji explained that it is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it. In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance.

 Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.

They were in shape of bees today.

JUST BE

 Joy is dissolving . . . losing your identity.

Rest is dissolving . . . losing your identity.

Love is dissolving . . . losing your identity.

The message for 1996 is . . . JUST BE!

Relax and just be.

That doesn't mean be lazy . . . No!

Be very busy . . . and just be.

The events come and go, they perish like flowers.

But every event and every person contains some honey.

Like a bee, just take the honey out of every event and every moment and move on.

 Be like a busy bee and be in the Being.

WRAPPING PAPER

 All sensory pleasures in the world are like wrapping paper; the true bliss is the present inside. Divine love is the present, yet we are holding onto the paper believing we have already enjoyed the gift. It's like putting the chocolate inside your mouth with the paper still on. A little chocolate may seep into the mouth, but the covering makes sores in the mouth. Unwrap the present. The whole world is there for you to enjoy. The wise know how to enjoy the gift inside, while the ignorant get stuck with the paper.

 

 Wally told Guruji: I have some property for you to consider as an Ashram in the U.S.

 Guruji said: I want every home to be an Ashram.

 How many of you consider your home to be an Ashram? If not, what keeps your home from being an Ashram? What are the impediments? What do you think are the qualities of an Ashram?

IS GURU SATISFIED (TRIPTH) OR

UNSATISFIED (ATRIPTH)?

 A student's job is to satisfy the Master.

But how can you satisfy someone who is already satisfied?

 If Guru is satisfied, then your growth is shunned.

If Guru is unsatisfied, he's away from the Self.

If Guru is satisfied, then what can inspire you to grow?

 If he's unsatisfied, he cannot be a Guru.

If he's satisfied, he cannot be a Guru.

 So what is the answer?

 

 NEWS FLASH

 Guruji arrived for the first time on January 15th in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. As soon as we landed, Guruji was driven straight to one of the largest concert halls in Zagreb. Guruji first met with a group of over a hundred professionals including doctors and members of the press. A few hours later the hall was filled to capacity for his evening lecture. The national television station filmed the entire talk. Over 100 people waited outside unable to enter.

 Before addressing the large crowd Guruji went out to the lobby and greeted those who could not enter. His talk was exquisite and a soft feeling of grace and peace transformed the atmosphere. At the end of the lecture many still waited outside for over two hours to get a glimpse of Guruji.

 The next evening Guruji gave his first talk in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Hundreds crowded into the World Trade Center. Guruji was soon overloaded with flowers from the group. Guruji continued to talk for an hour and a half as the enthusiastic crowd would not let him finish. The atmosphere was charged with immense gratitude and celebration. The Art of Living groups in Croatia and Slovenia have done an excellent job.

 Guruji now flies off to New York for a television interview and then it's on to the advanced course in Hawaii!

ADVICE FROM HAWAII

 What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend. Such time you give. This is not quality time.

 Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.

 

* * * *

 Here in Hawaii there is a fun-filled course, for you know God Loves Fun. This has been followed with the long-awaited book, Way of Grace. Satsang is open to the public each evening. The huge waves of the Hawaiian shores cannot compete with the waves of bliss at Satsang. Guruji has brought out deep Knowledge from the most mundane questions. We are making efforts to bring these tapes to you soon.

 

* * * *

What is most freely given yet not taken?

1. Compliments? . . . no.

2. Blame? . . . no, people take blame.

3. Money? . . . no, money is readily taken, not freely given.

4. Happiness? . . . nobody can give happiness.

5. ??

The clue is that it hangs in space like an orphan. No one owns it. Like an overripe papaya in Hawaii, it rots.

The answer to this riddle lies in the beginning.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOT IN THE UNIVERSE

 There is a place you can come where everything is beautiful. Tourists go from place to place looking for beauty. They try to take beauty from that place. They only get tired and tanned. Yet the most beautiful spot anywhere is right here. When you come here, you find that wherever you are, everything is so beautiful.

 Where is this place? Don't look here and there. Where do you go? Within you. When you come here, then any place is beautiful. Then wherever you go, you add beauty there.

 If you are unhappy, even the moon is irritating to you. Sweet things are nauseating, music is disturbing. When you are calm and centered inside, noise is musical, clouds are magical, rain is liquid sunshine.

 Book yourself on a trip to this most beautiful place in the universe. Then you find that every day is a vacation and a celebration.

 P.S. The answer to last weekÒ³ riddle is "advice." Advice hangs in the space, the giver goes on giving, the taker never takes. It goes on and on.

 

 And now the NEWS splash from the surf:

 A lady was driving along the coast of Kauai and just started singing our Bhajans which she had never heard before. Later she found herself at our Satsang.

 A Hawaiian Princess, Owana, found herself wondering why she felt compelled to drive in circles around a hotel in Honolulu. Later she found out from a devotee that it was Guruji's hotel. The next night she was singing her deeply felt native Hawaiian songs at Punditji's feet.

 On Sunday, a lady named Mary was spending the day at an ancient temple ruins. She had gone there to make an offering and to pray. Her prayer was to meet her spiritual teacher and be shown the way Home. On Monday, she met Punditji and instantly became devoted.

 Which one of your friends is next?

INDEBTEDNESS OR ABUNDANCE

 Question: God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt, except for some? Why do they have, and we don't have?

 Guruji: Is it only money? You have abundance, yet at the same time, you are indebted. So how can both be true? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?

 Somebody says: An abundance of indebtedness!

 Guruji: When you say you are indebted, that means you have received. Otherwise how can you be indebted? So be thankful for being indebted, because you have received. Those who have received should feel indebted. If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have.

 Question: When the disciples met Jesus, they were not very successful, did not catch very many fish. When they met Jesus, he told them exactly where to fish and that's when they got lots of fish and then they decided to follow Jesus.

 (Laughter)

 Guruji: Feel indebted. Feel gratitude. Then abundance comes. As long as you are wanting for abundance you get indebted. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes.

 Abundance and indebtedness coexist. You think you are indebted, but you really are not. It is better to feel totally indebted, because every bit of what you have, doesn't belong to you, including your body. Then you are infinitely indebted for your body, for Knowledge, for things you have received, and for your own life. Then you bask in the abundance of the Creator.

 Someone says: I feel very indebted. Thank you!

 

 NEWS FLASH:

 Physicians of Apple Valley had organized memorable meetings and Satsangs. Guruji was on CNN News. Guruji was in the media and newspapers for several days before the much awaited event. Local TV stations were announcing the event every hour.

 Guruji went to the University of Northeast Missouri that had sponsored his visit. Students and Lloyd had organized 700 people to welcome Guruji.

 

Guruji, not only in spirit, but also physically, piloted a twin engine Cessna plane back to St. Louis, Missouri on his way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

ABIDING IN THE SELF

 Abiding in the self you become the valentine for the whole world. Spirit is the valentine of matter and matter is the valentine of the spirit. They are made for each other. They uphold each other. If you hold onto matter and do not respect the spirit, then matter is not pleased. If you honor the spirit then you will care for the world, and when you care for the world, it will take care of you.

 I am the valentine of the whole world and I reside in every heart. If you are my valentine, you will see me everywhere. Have the same love for everyone, with different flavors. You cannot behave the same way with everyone, but you can love all of them the same. Love transcends behavior and etiquette.

 Just a week before Guruji's arrival, Raj woke up in the middle of the night in Loughborough. He thought that some light was coming from the clock. He looked at Guruji's picture and saw that light was coming from it. This light grew and filled the room. He made sure that there was no outside light left on. The divine light stayed on for about ten minutes.

 Upholland, Lancashire held an advanced course in Guruji's presence.

Guruji gave a talk on Ayurveda and the Art of Living at the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hall was full to capacity with standing room only, attended by medical professionals. It was a brilliant talk, but Punditji did not think so! He thought it was very mundane! There was great enthusiasm, however.

 Next, Guruji's entourage moved with luggage and cars at its own speed and proceeded to Stourbridge in the Midlands for a talk organized by Stourbridge Earth Mysteries. The talk was simply great! The entourage then moved on to London, arriving at 3 o' clock in the morning for "The UK Tired of Living Teacher's Meeting" with baggage, blankets, pillows, plastic bags, pots and pans, and the usual divine chaos!!

KNOWLEDGE AND FAITH

 In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows.

In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.

For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it, and all over the world they were used. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming. The same with antibiotics.

The knowledge brought faith, the knowledge changed, and then faith changed. The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Like Kriya, Yoga, and meditation -- first you have faith and then Knowledge follows. For example, if you do pranayama faithfully then you get the Knowledge of the prana; if your do your meditation faithfully, the Knowledge of consciousness follows. Even an illiterate, through faith, attains deep Knowledge.

Vinod: Human is the best composite material. (Laughter -- this is the NASA scientist mind.)

Punditji: Science considers even human as matter, and spirituality considers even earth as mother, even rivers and mountains as living beings.

Science regards life as matter and spirituality regards even matter as life.

NEWS FLASH:

Shivaratri was celebrated in London as well as in the German Ashram. Devotees had put their hearts and souls to make the place so beautiful. The puja and Satsang transported everyone to another plane. As usual, laughter filled the corridors of the new Ashram. The big hall was already too small to the surprise of everyone! Our own spring water replaced Pepsi and Coke!

Then on to Copenhagen -- the capital of Denmark. It was a media event: people from TV, radio, and the newspaper were queuing into the hotel. The TV crew followed to the public talks which were packed and very lively.

Then the giggling gang moved on to Norway, but had left some luggage behind in the hotel. The flight was conveniently delayed, which was very unusual for SAS. Lakshmi had called Guruji the night before. Guruji had said we will arrive at the airport at exactly 12:15. It kept Lakshmi wondering and confused because it was almost one hour later than the original arrival time. And they all arrived on the dot at 12:15!

RESPECT

 Why do you respect someone? Because of their good qualities, isn't it? For example, positive qualities like honesty, wisdom, love, talents, behavior. But all these change in time. And when they do change, you lose respect. You only respect the greatness.

 I have tremendous respect for each and every one. Not for their greatness or wisdom or talent, but for their very person. I respect everyone totally. So I can never lose respect for anybody, however they may be. One doesn't need to be great in order to be respected. Respecting the life makes you great. Don't look for respect from others; that makes you weak. Have respect for the self and no one can take your self-respect.

 Vinod and Ingrid turned a reluctant ambassador into an enthusiastic devotee, staying up all night reading the book "The Way of Grace."

 Adventure time: We all went to a ski simulator and then sledded three kilometers downhill. All the devotees tumbled down, all covered with snow and with frozen hands and feet. It was -10 C and everyone was wearing heavy winter clothes, but there was Guruji, sledding with sandals and shawl. He didn't get a speck of snow on Himself.

 Another programme entitled "The Three Wise Men" was made with one of Sweden's most respected TV journalists for a major TV channel. The three wise men included Guruji and the Dalai Lama.

FAITH AND LOVE

 God does not wish you to have more faith because the more faith you have, the more work for God. God will have to run behind you; then you start controlling Him. He is the servant of faithful servants and He does not want too many servants telling Him what He should be doing.

 Love is the highest strength, yet it makes you absolutely weak. So God/Enlightened One/Nature does not want you to have more faith or love. With too much faith and love, you make God weak.

 So, it is better for God that you have less faith. Things go on as they are. Why transform? Be happy.

 Meditation is seeing God in oneself.

Love is seeing God in the person next to you.

Knowledge is seeing God everywhere.

Expression of love is service.

Expression of joy is smile.

Expression of peace is meditation.

Expressing God is conscious action.

Before Guruji arrived in Delhi, everything was meticulously planned and organized. When Guruji arrived, there was a spontaneous Satsang at the airport. Airport personnel and other passengers joined in. It was sparkling! The well-organized plans went haywire and the usual divine chaos followed. Everything was settled in a flash but the organizers were left holding the plans on paper!

There was an air of celebration at Saritha Vihar Satsang. The sweets and flowers made a carpet in the large hall that matched the fragrance of joy. At Karol Bagh, the next day, there was more than one reason for the authorities to raise their eyebrows -- stampede in the room, traffic jam on roads, and devotees forgetting their families in their eagerness to follow the "Gurumobile." Then on to Rishikesh and the teachers' refresher course.

Rishikesh. The lush green Himalayas all around -- in the front, the holy Ganges that roars, gurgles, and sometimes murmurs -- the sounds mingling with the chirping of the birds -- the call of the peacocks in the early morning -- the chiming of the temple bells at sunrise -- the chanting of Vedic hymns at all times. Dip in the cold waters -- everyone clad in shawls and sweaters on their way in -- and most reluctant to leave afterwards. Sitting with Guruji in the evening, watching the sunset. Electrifying Satsangs and discourses on Bhagwad Gita in Hindi by Guruji, transport everyone to a blissful, celestial experience. More about Rishikesh next week.

 Guruji is still in Rishikesh. 350 people arrived from all over India for the advanced course -- a hundred more than expected. The volunteers had to run around trying to arrange rooms in the ashrams. During Satsang, the hall was spilling over with participants whose faces radiated ecstasy in the presence of the Master.

 It appeared that all the Gods from heaven came down to earth to the holy town of Rishikesh to bask in the glory of the Master. The powerful Himalayas and the divine Ganges echo the sounds of joy and the laughter of the devotees.

 Today is Gudi Padwa and Ugadi --- the new year celebrated in many parts of India. All 350 devotees went for a dip in the holy Ganges at 4:30 a.m. with Guruji oblivious to the temperature of the river. This was a new start to the new year in the presence of the Divine.

 The most renowned, 75-year old saint of Rishikesh, Swami Pragyanandji had a vision in which he saw Guruji as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh with many arms. He then performed a puja to Guruji.

BLAMING AND MISERY

When a worldly man is miserable, he blames the people around him, the system, and the world in general.

When a seeker is miserable he, of course, blames the world, but in addition he blames the path, the Knowledge, and himself.

It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker (sadhak) also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater. A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. Do you see what I am saying?

It is like a quantum leap. If one jumps across this threshold then there is no fall.

The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance.

Who will test? One who does not know will test, isn't it? God knows your capacity, so why does he have to test you? Then, why the misery? It is thithiksha, or forbearance, in you. And forbearance could be increased by prayerful surrender or vigorous challenge for patience! (Laughter)

News:

 Picnic to Neelkant hills and holy Haridwar was a grand finale to the Rishikesh course, followed by a wild Satsang in New Delhi. It was so charged! Guruji is back in the Ashram for a quiet three days before his Australian tour.

 From U.K.: Guruji had given a rose to a lady on February 13 and they called to say that the flower was still amazingly fresh and fragrant after six weeks! This miracle inspired an otherwise unwilling lady to do the course.

 Important exercise: Find out what it is that has been with you forever. Belma says that she asked herself this question 20 years ago and she knows all the answers. And that there is only one answer . . . . (Laughter)

ATTACHMENTS

Attachments cause feverish breath and feverish breath takes away peace of mind. Then you are in pieces and fall prey to misery. Before you get scattered too much, gather yourself and rid your breath of the feverishness through surrender and sadhana. Unfortunately most people do not notice this until it is too late.

When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team. Without fighting the attachments, observe the feverish breath and go to the cool place of silence within. Your first step in this direction is directing your attachment to the Knowledge, to the Divine.

Your non-attachment to the mundane is your charm. Your attachment to the Divine is your beauty.

 Guruji was sitting at the airport in Perth, Western Australia when he asked Joy what she did. She said, "I am an interior decorator." He said, "Oh, we do the same job."

 

NEWS FLASH:

 Thursday being Rama's birthday, Guruji gave a talk on Rama. It was stunning. Then we went to Madras for Satsang. Many dignitaries came to take Guruji's blessing, including the ex-President of India and his family. Brilliant questions and answers provided a moving Satsang.

 Singapore snatched a Satsang on the way to Australia.

 Perth packed them in and Sydney was swirling. Two fundamentalists verbally attacked Guruji as soon as he entered the hall, shocking the audience. Unshaken, Guruji delivered a powerful and eloquent discourse.

 In Ipswich, near Brisbane, Marcy taught a course. To the amazement of all the participants, the image of an Indian Goddess appeared on the leaf of a plant.

VIVEK

When you follow fun, misery follows you . . .

When you follow Knowledge, fun follows you.

 

* * * *

 If you say that you have no one in this world, then you are disowning me. And if you disown me then I cannot do anything for you.

 What is Vivek? Vivek means knowing that everything is changing. Time and again you have to awaken to this -- that the world, the people, our body, our emotions, are constantly changing.

 When you experience sorrow, understand that Vivek has been overshadowed.

 Question: What am I here for?

 Answer: Find out what you are not here for.

 1. You are not here to blame.

2. You are not here to cry.

3. You are not here to sleep.

4. You are not here to show off.

5. You are not here to fight.

6. You are not here to be miserable.

7. You are not here to be angry.

8. You are not here to worry.

 In Melbourne, Guruji activated the fire alarm and at the airport he activated the metal detector.

 After a beautiful advanced course in Melbourne Australia, Guruji is now in joyful Jakarta. Guruji was received with great fanfare at the airport by Kim and her entourage. Then Guruji blessed the land for a new Ashram. The initiative for this was taken by our dear Kim's husband, Mr. Tolani. Jakarta is vibrating with four Satsangs a day and flooding with tears of joy and devotion.

WORDS

 We attach meaning to words and we distort them, too. For example, the word "brainwashing." Like your body, your brain needs washing sometimes. You don't want to walk around with a dirty brain, a dirty mind. What is wrong with the word "brainwashing?" It indicates a clean brain, a clean mind, but it is used in a derogatory manner.

 Like that, the word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Like purana. It means "that which is new in the town, the most modern." But it is used in the sense of being old. In the course of time, meanings of words change. The word "enthused" comes from the Greek which means "God is with us." Then it came to mean crazy, and now it's changed again.

 Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being. It is the essence of all words. See and relate beyond words. Then there is no lie in your life.

 If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.

 

NEWS FLASH:

 Guruji was welcomed with the traditional Balinese dance and garlands. Then the press and TV crews invaded the hotel and splashed the news throughout Indonesia. All the press people were put into silent meditation and they came out with big smiles. Now they are arranging courses.

 Everything was magical. A thousand stars reflected over the Indian Ocean and the cliff side pool. Surprisingly, this course did not have chaos! The harmony on the course was so great that the hotel staff spontaneously started observing silence, communicating only through gestures and notes. Mr. and Mrs. Tolani and their whole team did a great job.

 After the farewell dinner outside by the lotus pools, we enjoyed a Balinese dance drama from the Ramayana. Afterwards we had a lively Satsang as drops began to fall from the heavens. Everyone was singing and dancing in the rain with Guruji.

KARMA

 Strange are the ways of Karma. The more you understand it, the more amazed you become. It brings people together and separates them. It causes some to be weak and some to be strong. It makes some rich and some poor. All the struggle in the world, whatever it may be, is the bondage of Karma. It cuts across all logic and reasoning. This understanding will lift you from getting stuck to the events or personalities and help you in your Journey to the Self.

 Question: So a thief can say it is my karma to steal?

 Answer: Then the police have the karma to catch him too! (Laughter)

 Only human life has the ability to be free from Karma. And only a few thousands aim to be free from it. Only through Grace can the bondage of Karma be burnt. Performing actions cannot eliminate Karma.

 

 NEWS SPLASH:

 There was a surprise sunset in the swimming pool in Bali.

 We visited many temples on the ocean coast. The local people honored Guruji by taking him into an ancient Shiva temple which does not allow tourists.

 In Singapore, huge crowds welcomed Guruji. Scores of people had to be turned away from a Public Utility Auditorium. Many dignitaries including ministers and officials of Singapore and Malaysia were present. Among the others were Chinese musicians and Indian dancers. There were four wonderful Satsangs a day and delightfully delicious food everywhere. Many courses, including those in the corporate sector, are in progress. The highlight of the tour was an unexpected awakening talk on the Upanishads that left everyone spellbound and speechless.

 After a lightening Satsang in Madras, Guruji is back in the Ashram for a series of celebrations.

SANYAS

 Sanyas means what? I am nothing and I want nothing, or I am everything and I have everything. And Sanyas is being colorless or multicolored. Your association or company can either elevate you or push you down. Company causes first an attraction and then delusion. This keeps your mind swinging between the two extremes and causes love and hatred. With the power of Knowledge and Satsang you can rise above this dilemma.

 

 NEWS SPLASH:

 The skies opened and grace poured down in buckets at the Ashram this week. It was a confluence of eight prominent saints of India who in a private meeting honored Guruji in one of their ashrams. Each of these saints gives lectures or Darshan to hundreds of thousands of devotees and they all run their own schools, hospitals and ashrams. Four of them who were just introduced to Guruji followed us for a brief tour of our Ashram.

 When they were all at Sumeru Mantap, lightening and thunder surrounded us and everyone was drenched and then they ran to Guruji's kutir. Immediately these very popular and formal Sanyasis began to shed their orange garments. But what to give them to wear? Guruji gave them all white dhotis. Soon they were all wearing our Guruji's white dhotis and being fed by his hand looking more and more like a group of joyful children happy to be home again. Somehow in their "new clothes" they began to relax and smile and laugh and soon the grace of our Guru had them radiating from deep inside.

 All of us were shocked to see how the formal heads of institutions were transformed and by the time they were leaving, they humbly asked for Guruji's blessings and invited him to their ashrams and to lead them in meditation. They said, "Mother Nature gave us all a bath before entering your temple, Guruji." We stood and watched this event with awe and laughter.

 The first advanced course has started at the Ashram.

 LATE NEWS:

 Guruji took over fifty people to see the night safari in Singapore which is the only night safari in the world. The guide kept saying that our group was unusually lucky because every single animal in the forest came near the tram "to give or take Darshan!" The local people who have been to this place several times were so surprised.

ILLUSION

Illusion is error of perception and knowing illusion as illusion is Knowledge. Our experience of the world is based on perception. Since every perception is erroneous, the world is an illusion. Experiences are all of perception. The experiencer is the only reality. Look for the seer, the experiencer, in between experiences. Every experience leaves a hangover and clouds the intellect. Wake up this moment. Shake your head of all past experiences and look at the pure Being that I am and that you are.

Question: How do you distinguish the experience and the experiencer?

Answer: Are you really all here? Are you listening? Now close your eyes and see who is listening, who is questioning, who is sitting, and who wants what? Who is confused? You may not get any answer but that is fine. Never mind.

 NEWS FLASH:

 Chinese movie maker tried his level best to sign up Guruji for his latest block buster. Guruji said, "I don't know acting," and the movie maker said, "Just be natural, accept the situation as it is, take responsibility, be 100%." The movie is about a wise man who brought Buddhism to China. The movie maker said that through this mega performance, the Art of Living would reach the whole of China. Guruji winked at his devotees and said, "Should I change my profession?"

 The first advanced course ended and the second has begun. The Ashram is bustling with people. Every inch of space is occupied -- three times the holding capacity of the Ashram and yet no complaints. No chaos! So smooth! Only laughter and new songs have filled Sumeru Mantap.

SELF

 Self is not just the mind-body complex. Often people think of the Self as the mind-body complex. This is an erroneous notion. Neither the body nor the mind is the Self. All the yoga you do is for the body. All the meditation you do is for the mind.

 Whether calm or disturbed, your mind remains mind.

Whether sick or well, your body remains body.

Self is all-encompassing.

  Service without attitude

Love without reason

Knowledge without intellect

Life beyond time and events

Is what you are.

 The only purpose for this body to exist is to make you aware of how beautiful you are, and to make you aware that it is possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you.

  

NEWS FLASH:

 There is a star named after Guruji. Thanks to Jody, the international Star Registry has named a star "Sri Sri Ravishankar."

 The Ashram was specially lit up to match the smiles of about a thousand devotees from all over. Tents were pitched for people. Thanks to the excellent organizing and the volunteers who made everyone feel very special and taken care of. Belma says it was not chaos as expected!

 The sacred Vedic chants in the morning air, the elaborate afternoon meal, laughter and dancing in the evening were all simply magical. Everyone danced with candles in their hands and Sumeru Mantap looked like a festive cake.

 The third advanced course has begun.

ENLIGHTENMENT

 Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree.

 Sometimes the question comes up "What's the use of all these courses? Your behavior has not changed!"

 The Knowledge acquired by a human being cannot be measured or judged by external behavior. Someone may behave as though they have absorbed all the Knowledge but internally they have not. The reverse is also true. Someone who seems to have not changed at all may have absorbed a lot.

 Ordinary people would just look at the behavior, but the intelligent looks beyond and is amazed by the play of the consciousness (Brahman).

  Behavior affects relationships

Attitude affects behavior

Knowledge or ignorance affects attitude

Grace brings forth Knowledge.

Your inside is like a tree; in some seasons barren and at other times blossomed. Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree which yields throughout the year.

NEWS FLASH:

 The third advanced course (in Tamil) not only melted the hearts but also a gallstone of a participant! Many more healing experiences were reported -- like the minds, blocked arteries also opened. Guruji held the rains for almost an hour as an intense Satsang was underway in Sumeru Mandap.

 Guruji is presiding over a big conference for Awakening the Society organized by several spiritual heads in the state before he takes off for a rendezvous in Paris.

SAMADHI

 A single cell becomes the whole body. Somewhere it is nails, somewhere it is nose and tongue but all is a manifestation of a single cell. In the same way, the entire universe is made up of a single substance.

 Remembering and FEELING that everything is made up of one thing heals the body and mind and balances the doshas in the body (vata, pitta and kapha). This is savitarka samadhi. Savitarka samadhi means equanimity with logical awareness.

 Deep sleep can be jada samadhi (equanimity with inertia). And hence, sleep is the main factor in healing. Even medicines will not help without sleep and rest.

 Samadhi with ecstasy has no logic. This is nirvitarka samadhi, awareness with bliss.

 Nirvitarka samadhi is even beyond the experience of bliss, undefinable beyond words.

 

 NEWS FLASH:

 Just on the outskirts of Paris, the advanced course at the Hotel Leonardo da Vinci was great. The manager at the hotel turned into a devotee and expressed that his place was never filled with so much love and light. The Satsang, sight-seeing, and the feast on the boat in Paris at night was a rendezvous with the Divine.

 The next morning five cars and a mini-van set out for Holland without any proper address but the miracle was that everybody reached the lecture hall in time. Some were fuming that they had not been given any address or telephone numbers.

 They all cooled down in one minute as Guruji smiled and said, "Have trust and fun. If you lose your smile for small things, then what is the use of being with me? It is a double waste of time, yours and mine." The celebration continued past midnight and this Knowledge Sheet was born.

 (Laughter)

 Stefano says, "What about something you think you know but don't know?"

 Guruji says, "We can talk about something you think you know but you don't know or something you think you don't know but you know." (Laughter)

 There is no end to learning but there is an end to unlearning. That is when you become totally hollow and empty.

 On the way back from Holland to the German Ashram we had a picnic on the banks of the river Rhine near beautiful Boppard.

 The Ashram was filled to its capacity. Teacher Training Phase 1 and 2 and the advanced course were in full swing.

Today marks the one year anniversary of these Knowledge Sheets. The year which started in Big Sur and is ending in St. Louis, began in KNOWLEDGE and is concluding in SEVA. Knowledge Sheets now go to more than 300 Satsang groups touching 7000 people every week around the world!

SEVA IS SAVIOR

 The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible. Your inner most source is joy.

 The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" "what can I gain from this world?" think "what can I do for the world?" When everyone comes from the point of contributing to society, you have a Divine society. We have to educate and culture our individual consciousness in order to expand in time with the Knowledge . . . from "what about me?" to "what can I contribute?"

 If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. When you bring some relief or freedom to someone through seva, good vibrations and blessings come to you. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.

 

 Answer to last week's riddle:

 That something which is so precious to you is your smile -- your joy. You lose it in the world and find it in the self, in Satsang. If you can't find it here, at the Ashram, forget about it. Your can't find it anywhere.

 

 NEWS FLASH:

 After a quick two day stopover in Boston with overflowing crowds at Interface and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and with lively late night Satsangs, Guruji arrived in Pittsburgh to a packed schedule of household Satsangs, temple visits, two lectures, and a celebration to inaugarate our new Center complete with cake flying in all directions! Guruji caught up on rest and met many new devotees in Cleveland before arriving today in St. Louis.

WHEN WE ARE JOYFUL

 When we are joyful, we don't look for perfection. If you are looking for perfection then you are not at the source of joy. Joy is the realization that there is no vacation from wisdom. The world appears imperfect on the surface but underneath, all is perfect. Perfection hides; imperfection shows off.

 The wise will not stay on the surface but will probe into the depth. Things are not blurred; your vision is blurred. Infinite actions prevail in the wholeness of consciousness. And yet the consciousness remains perfect, untouched. As Satsangees, realize this now and be at Home.

 Koan (riddle) of the week: You better straighten out and become we. We are always one and you could be two. Answer next week . . .

 NEWS FLASH from BBC (Beautiful British Columbia):

 In St. Louis a man diagnosed with a malignancy in his shoulder came to receive Guruji's blessings. The next day he came to Satsang and to the astonishment of the doctors, the man had been healed even though the MRI had shown a tear and a growth on the shoulder cuff. As the man told his story and presented a dozen red roses to Guruji, tears of gratitude rolled down everyone's cheeks. There were many reported healing experiences in St. Louis and Chicago.

 The Chicago organizers said, "Here comes the Art of Living circus to town." (Laughter) There was an air of celebration as the devotees from the U.S. Midwest gathered with non-stop giggling and laughter. People were driving in circles, forgetting traffic rules, not sleeping, and laughing as Guruji (our sit-down comedian) amazed everyone.

 We rushed on to Portland. Dean says we have become Rushins instead of American, Indians, and Canadians. At The Old Church, there was not even standing space. The sight of Guruji put smiles on every face.

 In Vancouver, the Aboriginal People warmly hosted Guruji at the University of British Columbia. The sky, the sea, the snow-capped mountains, the tall trees and the waterfalls all beckoned for the Knowledge.

 Sudarshana left the room for five minutes and returned asking, "What did I miss?" Marcy said, "Enlightenment!" (Laughter)

JUDGEMENTS AND GOOD COMPANY

Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement. Otherwise your judgement gets solidified like a rock. It brings misery for you and for others.

If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They could bring a foul smell, then move away. They should not stay there forever.

Judgements are so subtle that you are not even aware of their existence. Judging or labeling someone as judgmental is also a judgement. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements.

Yet the world cannot move without judgements. Until you judge something as good or bad, you cannot do any actions. If you see rotten apples in the market, you say, "No good." Good ones you buy. If someone lies to you ten times, you think next time it also could be a lie. A judgment happens automatically.

See the possibility that people and things can change at any time and don't hold onto the judgements.

You need to judge your company. Your company can pull you up or pull you down. The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company.

When someone complains, first you listen, then you nod, then you sympathize, then you complain.

Robert says, "Join the party." Denise says, "I confess, you are absolutely right." (Laughter)

Your company can create Hell for you in Heaven -- or Heaven for you in Hell. Judge for yourself . . . !

 The Circus goes to Ottawa:

 Enthusiastic Suzannah and party had organized a hall at the palatial Chateau Laurier. There was Guruji, sitting on his beautifully decorated seat next to a huge pile of super-sized bananas. In the darshan line he had to hand out over 300 bananas, one by one, like a banana vendor. There were piles of bananas everywhere.

 Guruji said, "Let's all close the eyes and meditate," and everyone was sitting there peeling their bananas. Denise got stuck with her banana peel. She didn't know what to do with it. She (and everyone else) ended up meditating while holding their banana or banana peel like some kind of religious ceremony.

Thanks to Janice, the Ayurvedic Course at the Ashram was a great success. The celebration continues in Montreal . . .

GOD IS A THOROUGH BUSINESSMAN

The Divine has given you all the small pleasures in the world, but has kept the bliss to Himself. To get the highest bliss you have to go to Him and Him alone.

Don't be too smart with the Divine and try to fool Him. Most of your prayers and rituals are just attempts to trick the Divine. You try to give the least and get the maximum out of the Divine and He knows. He's an astute businessman; He will trick you even more. If you go underneath the carpet, He will go underneath the floor.

Be sincere in your attempts. Do not try to outsmart the Divine. Once you get the bliss, then everything else is joyful. Without the bliss, joy in anything in the world will not stay.

 NEWS FLASH:

 We emerged from silence to celebrate at the lake the fifth anniversary of the Ashram. It was like a fairytale with the full moon rising above the trees, the sounds of Susannah's and Phillip's flutes, fireworks, and bonfires. The Guru took us spinning in circles on a raft and to our surprise brought us back to the same shore. In the confusion, we forgot to serve the anniversary cake.

 After the Montreal talk, Denise drove off with Guruji in the car with all the doors open. Ramola ran from behind and jumped in. In the fever to get into the Guru's car, somebody left luggage behind, another left a purse, another left their shoes, and they all left their minds.

 Guruji and Phillip have just left for Toronto and then are to go to Colorado.

 On the 14th of July an Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference will be sponsored by the Art of Living in Washington DC. Ten Swamis from India have been invited.

 Thomas called Punditji to tell him that a forest fire raging at Lake Tahoe which burned many million dollar houses, came up to his property, burned his tool shed, but stopped at his front door. Neither his home -- where many Satsangs had been held -- nor his garden were damaged.

SURRENDER AND RESPONSIBILITY

 

Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal. You will take it easy. We have to make a distinction. Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible."

Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.

It appears to be opposing and conflicting in nature -- in fact they are two sides of the same coin. The more you surrender, the more responsive you become. One who is irresponsible cannot surrender either. Why is someone irresponsible? They are lazy or fearful or both. If you are lazy or fearful, you cannot be in love.

Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Suppose you are surrendered to the Knowledge. That means you are committed to sharing it with others. You take responsibility to see that it flourishes.

Question: The confusion comes with the doership?

Answer: When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember "surrender." That gives you strength to move ahead. It releases you from the weight of the doership. Responsibility is the dynamic expression of life in the present moment. When you are shaken, remember the basis of responsibility as surrender.

Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Total irresponsibility is impossible for you. Limited responsibility makes you weak. A little water in the sun will evaporate but the ocean never dries up. Limited responsibility tires you out. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.

 NEWS FLASH:

 The fireworks arrived July 4th with Guruji at Colorado's largest advanced and basic courses ever. The hall was dressed with red, white, and blue balloons and ribbons in celebration of Independence (of the United States and our spirits). As we watched the explosions spread across the horizon, Guruji said, "That looks just like your minds." Guruji took a hike in the mountains and then met an enthusiastic crowd in Colorado Springs before flying on to California. There was a Satsang in Anu and N.J.'s home in Apple Valley for over 150 devotees before the Art of Living entourage moved on to northern California. There have been non-stop talks and Satsangs celebrating Guruji's summer tour to the U.S.

RESPECT EVERYBODY AS YOU RESPECT ME

Respect everybody as you respect Me, but don't expect from everyone what you expect from Me.

You do it the other way. You don't respect everybody as you respect Me, but you expect them to give you joy and behave ideally. When they don't live up to your expectations, you get frustrated and you blame or curse them. By cursing, you lose your spiritual energy. Blessing brings your spiritual energy up.

The world is full of differences and arguments are inevitable. With forbearance or patience and wisdom, skillfully make your way up.

If you find fools around you, they are going to make you wiser. The number of fools around you indicates the strength of your centeredness. Don't try to get rid of them! (Laughter)

If you are not centered you will have no patience to put up with them. When you are totally established, you find the fools come up with wisdom. They are your own reflection, there is no other. Fools offer you frustration and wisdom. Be choosy and make your life juicy.

Hmm . . . What do you say? I think this is something very timely.

Question: How can you stop thinking others are fools?

Answer: You don't have to. You can see the whole world as fools. The advantage is you don't get attached to anyone. (Laughter) No one likes to associate with fools. If you think people are sane, you want to join them.

You can think everybody is a fool and be cool.

 

NEWS from Washington, DC:

The Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference was wonderful and dramatic. Suzannah opened the Conference with her beautiful Hallelujah Bhajan and was joined by everyone. Children sang traditional devotional songs, and delegates from many faiths lit candles, offered deeply felt prayers, sang sweet hymns and led us in meditation. Represented were the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Bahai's, Buddhism, Church of Christ, Islam, Sufism, the Unity Church, Free Masonry, Hinduism, Presbyterian and Sikh, among others. An African holy man swathed in flowing white robes bowed before each delegate and the audience.

The nine Swamis from India, in their golden robes, dramatically entered the auditorium during the program and gave their blessings to Guruji. Guruji, sitting in the center of them all, provided the closing meditation. John was master of ceremonies and did a wonderful job staying centered amidst the chaos of program changes that nobody even noticed!

The Satsang that evening in the local Hindu Temple was sweet and full of lively spiritual energy. Guruji in white, sitting on the stage surrounded by the golden robed Swamis was a beautiful sight!

DOING VERSUS HAPPENING

Only one who is 100 percent in doing can recognize the happening.

The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing. If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along. And when you see the present as happening, then laziness and unawareness set in. If you apply the doing for the future, it brings tension and worry. If you apply the happening for the future, it might bring some confidence and also lethargy.

Let the happening be for the past. Let the doing be for the present. And the future is a mix of both.

The wise will see the doing in happening and the happening in doing simultaneously. Are you confused now? (Laughter)

One who does a lot of work will never say he did a lot. When someone says he did a lot of work, that means he can do more. He has not done enough.

Work does not tire you as much as the doership does. All the talents you have are for others. If you have good voice, it is for others. If you are a good cook, it is for others. If you write a good book, it is for others. What do you do? You donÒ´ sit and read your own book! If you are a good carpenter, it is for others. So all of your talents are useful for others. If you are a good surgeon, it is for others. You cannot do your own surgery. This is interesting. If you are school teacher, it is for others. You cannot teach your own children; they donÒ´ listen to you anyway. So all your work and talents are for others.

 

If you donÒ´ make use of your talents, they will not be given to you again.

 

NEWS -- Metamorphosis:

The German Academy is transformed overnight. It has become more elastic than rubber in its ability to accommodate course participants. The enthusiasm of seva has gone beyond limits. Guruji has to walk around in the middle of the night telling people to go to bed.

The Ashram is radiating so much love that the postman kept polishing the letterbox outside the Ashram for a long time without knowing why.

Guru Purnima is moving into the German Academy.

Today is a gift from God -- that is why it is called "present!"

DON'T BE GRATEFUL!

 Warning! Watch out! This Knowledge Sheet contains explosives! It can explode your head or your heart. If it explodes your heart -- nothing is left! If it explodes your head -- everything is attained!

 Guruji: How many of you are grateful here? (Everybody raises their hand.) If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! (Everyone is shocked.) You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate. You are not grateful to yourself.

 Gratefulness is inevitable. When you go beyond gratefulness, then union happens. No "I," no "you" remains. You are part of the Master. You are just One Being with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, but with one heart. You have got to be grateful on the path, but you have to transcend gratefulness. Better stop being grateful. (Laughter.)

 When you are grateful then you are the center, you are more important. When you are grateful to God for having received something beautiful, for example, eyesight, who is important? You or God? You! So your gratitude indicates ego.

 Richard: But you are not grateful?

Guruji: I am simply great and I am full! (Laughter) Don't be grateful; just be great -- and be full! (Laughter)

 This Knowledge is very dangerous! When you are part of the Master, you have every right to be happy. You have every right to Knowledge, happiness, and the whole universe!

Angelika: Small children donÒ´ feel grateful as long as they feel one. They take everything for granted.

Meike: You are not grateful to your own hand which feeds you.

Ananda: On one of the courses you said in the thanking process, "Now, thank yourself for being here!" So you can thank yourself.

Guruji: if you wish, you can! This is true celebration: thanking yourself!

* * * *

 Balder: Could you say something about the relationship to friends and the relationship to the Master?

Guruji: Your friends tie you to the world, to the matter. The Master ties you to the Divine, to the spirit.

NEWS FLASH:

 Guru Purnima was celebrated all around the world. In the German Academy, people who had been there earlier could not believe their eyes. The Seva Warriors had made such a magic on the whole building. The "Moonwalk" on the mountain after Satsang was simply great and everyone was full!

Faith and Devotion

Faith is the subject of head. Devotion is the subject of heart. And meditation is of both and connects both.

A mature intellect is devoted. A mature heart is full of knowledge. And meditation matures your intellect as well as your heart.

Mr. John Pb: But people with good intellect seem to have less faith.

Guruji: They have more faith in the matter. Head puts the faith in the matter more and heart puts the faith in the abstract more.

It's next to impossible that one can be in total lack of faith or total lack of devotion. It's only a question of balance.

 

NEWS FLASH

Guruji arrived at the Washington airport and drove to three Satsangs and had dinner, then dinner, then dinner. Next day Bhanu shopped from 10 am to 5 pm.

Bhanu says, "Don't write that!"

Dr. Ganesh Prabhu, one of the leading cardiovascular surgeons, formerly of Johns Hopkins Hospital, asked if he could sit and meditate alone with Guruji without anyone else around. The deal was struck. Dr. Prabhu used a holter monitor on Guruji to measure the heart function while he was meditating. Afterwards Guruji departed for Los Angeles.

Dr. Prabhu called Guruji at about 8:00 that evening with the information that the heart rate recorded went from 10 per minute to 2 and stopped completely twice. He was even more excited and amazed that the machine kept recording a heartbeat for nearly 10 hours after being disconnected from Guruji. He asked, "What happened? What happened?" His joy knew no limits. Never before in his career had he seen anything like this. He said he would frame the read-out.

Guruji arrived in Los Angeles for the long-awaited Summer Celebration. Sixty people were on seva teams with Ann McFadden at the helm. Nine swamis who were our guests began an intensive sightseeing campaign, dragging Wally and John through Disneyland, Universal Studios, and Sea World starting at 8:00 in the morning. Often you could hear the swamis saying, "Where is Honey?" (Wally's motor home.)

There was a grand Satsang in San Diego with the Swamis. Then as Guruji arrived in L.A. there was a memorable Prayer Conference evening at the famous Agape Center. Everyone spoke about unity. Then Guruji stood up and shocked the audience by saying, "Unity is impossible." He continued by explaining that in order for there to be unity, there has to be two. Yet there is only One in the whole universe.

Next day Guruji gave a beautiful talk at the Unity Church in Tustin. "All of your life becomes a meditation," he said. "Whether you look at the trees or the flowers or talk with people, you are in meditation." He encouraged people to stay with their daily meditation practice. After the talk we all looked up and saw a big puffy heart in the clear blue sky. That evening there was an electrifying Satsang with many birthdays at the Doubletree Hotel with 350 course participants.

INFINITE PATIENCE AND SMART SHOPPING

Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.

When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience. When you have infinite patience, you will realize God belongs to you. Either through awareness or through practice you reach the same spot.

Question: What do you mean by "owning God?"

Answer: The Divinity belongs to you. It's not like shopping at the supermarket in a hurry and rushing back home. When you see the whole store is at home, you are not in a hurry to shop. You are at ease.

Question: To develop patience do we just observe the impatience?

Answer: Just observe the thoughts and feelings and don't regret about it.

When you know you are part of the divine plan, you stop demanding. Then you know everything is being done for you. You are taken care of. Usually we do it the other way: we hurry the mind and are slow in our action. Impatience means hurry in the mind; lethargy means slowness in action. Patience in the mind and dynamism in action is the right formula.

SURRENDER - SHAME AND SHYNESS

In surrender the head bends and meets the heart. The head that does not bend has no value, and the head that is stiff will have to bend sometime, either in surrender or in shame. The head that bends in surrender will never have to bend in shame. Shame accompanies arrogance. Shyness accompanies Love. See how children are endowed with shyness, that is natural. Shyness is inherent. Shame is inflicted by society and is acquired. Shame brings guilt and shyness adds to oneÒ³ beauty. Retain your shyness and drop your shame.

Parag and Parul were taken by surprise when the food brought just for Guruji and four others was fed to forty people and still there was some left over.

The Advanced Teacher Training was immensely beneficial and the teachers left with renewed wisdom and fire.

As people would crowd into Verna's home and the slamming of car doors after midnight was awakening the entire Bayliss neighborhood, so Guruji played a trick and took everyone to the beach! A big group gathered in the airport, there was a change in flight, and the airport authorities requested our people not to crowd! Rajshree's family hosted a nice Satsang in Yonkers. A public Satsang was given for the first time in Princeton, New Jersey and the talk in New York was greatly admired by everyone. Guruji gave four television programs in this tour, including The Discovery Channel and Korean TV. Before boarding the plane to the UK, Guruji took a private visit to the amusement park (with only 40 people) and the water rides and the roller coaster were great fun.

SPECIAL? ORDINARY?

Are you special or ordinary?

What makes you special on the path? (Everyone is silent) Your perception, observation, and expression have advanced. What makes you ordinary on the path is that you are special! (Laughter) . . . . Because everybody thinks they are very special in some way or another!

Your perception has improved. You see the cause behind every cause, the Divine, and you see the great plan behind every small plan. You don't see the intentions behind others's mistakes and you are not a doubting Thomas.

Kiran: Who was doubting Thomas?

Shirley: Thomas doubted Jesus.

Bhanu: But I think he also got enlightened!

Stefano: Yes, but he was not sure! (Laughter)

Before getting onto the path you never observed your emotions. Now you observe your emotions, positive or negative, love or hatred, anger or compassion, pain or pleasure. Your observation has improved.

Your expression has improved. In the center-core of everyone there are all the good qualities. In the unfortunate and stressed ones it has not found an expression, but you have given an expression to these great qualities.

And soooo . . . . . you are extra . . . ordinary!

The hot media topic of the week on the Guernsey Islands was the Art of Living and Guruji's long awaited visit. Jean and Renwick invited the parliamentarians and health care professionals for a meeting with Guruji after the most lively talk.

On one of the earlier tours when Guruji asked on what topics to speak, amidst all different topics, a gentleman suggested "used cars." Can you believe this! Guruji spoke about used cars the whole evening and compared them with our body and mind. No one can catch the Guru!

Then on to Norway for the extraordinary residential week-long basic course with 150 people, historic for Scandinavia . . . . WOW! (Can you say all that in one breath?)

WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE

After the Satsang a small group of about 150 people met with Guruji and were playing with the words and arguing with him and telling him how mean he is that he doesn't spend much time with them and yet has stolen their hearts. Guruji kept winning by twisting their arguments and people laughed like anything.

Guruji: Whether you win or lose an argument with me you are still laughing. Why?

Because there is total sense of belongingness. When there is a total sense of belongingness, real play happens. Winning or losing is irrelevant.

Normally what happens to you when you lose an argument? You are sad and upset, hurt and angry. But when you lose or win an argument with me you are still happy. How come?

1. There is a sense of belongingness.

2. Your love stands out and everything else becomes secondary. Like perfection, comfort,

desires, etc. Isn't it?

3. Your ability to put the "Being" before the happening.

4. And your confidence in the ultimate good.

CanÒ´ you have this same attitude with everyone?

Today is Krishna's birthday. Krishna's life was full of conflicts and yet he kept smiling and dancing. May you dance through the conflicts and contribute to this planet.

Bombay was in a hot mood for a wild Satsang but in cool weather! Then on to Surat which was hectic. The spectacular decorations and the vibrant Satsangs thrilled the thousands who gathered to get a glimpse of Guruji. The next morning in Baroda, Guruji addressed a rapt audience of 700 senior executives. In the evening Satsang the assembly hall of the palace of Baroda was an apt royal setting. Thanks to Kartik for setting up closed circuit TVs -- the overflowing crowd did not feel lost.

Even a curious ant could not walk into the jam-packed Satsang in Ahmedabad as thousands basked in devotion and Knowledge, and Guruji stood up majestically to address them -- what a space!

Today is Krishna's birthday and all planes are leading to Bangalore.

THE WELL BAKED POT

If you pour water into a half baked pot, the pot becomes wasted and so does the water. If the pot is well baked and strong, then it does not matter whether you put the water into the pot or the pot into the water.

During Satsang that evening a devotee presents a beautiful hand crafted pot to Guruji. Another devotee presents a bouquet of roses. Placing the bouquet into the pot Guruji says, "If the pot is well baked, then it will hold the flowers."

Yet another gift of sweets is given to Guruji and He adds, "When you blossom the sweets come to you." Then came a box of (Sandesh) Sweets and Guruji concluded, "This is today's sandesh." (Sandesh is the Hindi word for message.)

THE FALL THAT RAISES

You only see the fall of the water. You don’t see how the Ocean becomes the Cloud. The ocean becoming the cloud is a secret, but the cloud becoming the ocean is obvious.

In the world only a few can notice your inner growth and height, but your outer expressions are apparent.

Never brood that people don’t understand you. They can only see your expression!

NEWS FLASH

RIDDLE: The first Advanced Course started after the first Advanced Course ended. Actually it was the third Advanced Course. Now the second Advanced Course has started, but actually it is the fourth.

On the Ganesha festival day, Guruji gave a most revealing talk on Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity -- its name, form, quality and many secrets.

Guruji was invited to inaugurate the Shiva temple and the Satang hall at Adichunchinagiri Mutt Blind School. All the 125 teacher trainees, in several buses and cars, accompanied Guruji to the inauguration and them proceeded to the waterfalls.

It was an exquisite evening. Nature was brilliantly displaying herself in all her glory -- pink and golden skies with spectacular cloud patterns, rolling hills, clement weather, MAGNIFICENT waterfalls...

Dinesh: We should have come here without you Guruji.

Everybody was shocked because they went to the falls because Guruji went.

Dinesh: Now we are only looking at you. (Applause)

Guruji: Hmmm... Look at the water. Even the fall is beautiful. If a rock falls it shatters, but when water falls it generates power and beauty. Being somebody is being like a stone, being nobody is being like the water. Being everybody is like water vapor.

Bharat: More people are interested in news than Knowledge.

Bawa: Then we will put more Knowledge in the news.

WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE - YOUR SMILE OR YOUR ANGER?

Mahesh: Do you get angry? If so, how often?

Guruji: I can but it's very expensive.

Usually, you give your anger freely and smile rarely as though a smile is costly. In ignorance, anger is cheaper and a smile is costly. In Knowledge, a smile is free like sun, air, and water and anger is extremely expensive like a diamond.

Conclusion: Make your Smile cheaper and anger expensive.

NEWS FLASH

After a busy course schedule in the Ashram, Bangalore, Guruji addressed a large group of professionals and industrialists in Rajkot followed by an enthusiastic Satsang of more than 3000 devotees. Decorations and the organization and spirit of the enthusiastic crowd set an example. Guruji left for an advanced course of nearly 700 participants in Koijavaran, Baroda.

P.S. Although the Knowledge Sheet was prepared on time last week there was a delay in sending it and this brought up an interesting fax from Ottawa, Canada which is enclosed here as a supplement:

Thank you for this week's very eloquent Knowledge Fax. We continue to ponder its meaning. In deciphering its meaning we rely on clues that you have given previously. You have said, "I am always talking to you. You only have to look for a sign."

We recognize that many people will say, "There was no Knowledge Fax this week." Of course, they are mistaken. Some people will say, "The Guru finally missed a deadline. Of course, He is just human, like everyone else. He probably ran out of things to say, got tired. Maybe there was no computer nearby. Maybe he called in sick." Some people, asleep, may not have noticed.

However, knowing that the Guru is communicating even when He says nothing at all, we seek the deeper meaning of the week's Knowledge Sheet or Nonsheet. Let us simply say, We seek the deeper meaning of this week's Sandesh.

Option 1: It is all changing

Everything is changing. Nothing stays for all time. "Life is teaching us, at every moment, the art of letting go." Even Knowledge Faxes will not be there for ever. Letting Go. Ultimately we must let go of even the Knowledge as object, as something "out there."

Option 2. I am the Knowledge

Living the knowledge, becoming the knowledge. That is what we must aspire to. The Knowledge Fax is not just a piece of paper, a bit of amusement each week, which titillates the intellect and which we promptly forget, and go about our meaningless and mundane lives.

Sub-Option 2.1. "Enough Knowledge has been given. Digest that."

We must assimilate the Knowledge that has already been given, make it a part of us. There is a rhythm in all things. The cycle of the year goes around again. The cycle of the Knowledge as well. Let us remember and re-learn the knowledge given in the previous cycle.

Option 3. Grace and Gratitude

"To those who have, more will be given. To those who have not, even what little they have will be taken away from them. "

How much gratitude have we had for the Knowledge that has been given each week? How much have we valued the Knowledge Faxes? How much awareness, how much attention have we put on them? Have they become just another routine, something else to take for granted? Wherever we put our attention, that will increase. Have we not put enough attention on the Knowledge Sheets each week?

Option 4. Silence

Truth is beyond words. Therefore whatever we speak is false. Only in silence can we know the Truth. Only in silence can we be the Truth.

Meditate. Be silent. Know thy Self.

Option 5. The Unbaked Pot

When you pour water into an unbaked pot, the water is wasted, and so is the pot. Before you put water into a pot, you should bake the pot. The Guru is now baking all the pots. When they are baked, then he will be able to fill them with the water of Knowledge. But for now, why waste all that good water?

Objection: But how can the pots be baked without the Fire of Knowledge?

This is a very good point. I suppose there are other fires. The fire of criticism and humiliation; the fire of hunger; the fire of lust; the fire of longing; the physical fire of heat. You should ask the Guru to speak on the five fires.

Option 6. The Answer to Last Week's Non-riddle

Look for the meaning hidden in all the events. And a non-event is also an event. There was a "sandesh" contained within the box of Sandesh sweets given to the Guru last week. Similarly, what is the meaning hidden in this week's non-fax?

"Let those who have ears hear." Hearing the silence. This is what we must do.

Option 7. Just Testing

The Guru is testing our level of dismay at not receiving a fax this week. It seems that the level of dismay was appropriately high, as it now appears a fax has indeed been sent, albeit belatedly. (I just called Bill Hayden. Poor Bill. Apparently a good proportion of the people on the continent also called him.)

So what to read into this? Possibility: The Guru is soft-hearted, he cannot bear our disappointment. Or: The Guru is disappointed. We did not receive the silent fax he sent; so he was obliged to send a fax containing words. Or: The Guru is pleased. Our collective dismay at not receiving a fax this week proved to him that we do deeply value the Knowledge given each week and we are extremely grateful or ? ? ?

Jai Guru Dev

P.P.S. The above Knowledge Fax Supplement was sent by Susannah and the Ottawa Satsang group on 21st September regarding Knowledge Fax #67.

BALANCE AND DISCIPLINE

People who are free, regret that they don't have discipline. They keep promising that they will become disciplined. People who are disciplined look for the end. (Discipline is not an end in itself, it is a means.)

Look at the people who have no discipline; they are miserable. Freedom without discipline is absolute misery. Discipline without freedom is suffocating.

Orderliness is monotonous and chaos is stressful.

We have to make the discipline free and the freedom disciplined.

People who are in company all the time, they look for the comforts of solitude. People who are in solitude, feel so lonely and want to be in company.

People who are in a cold place want to be in a warm place. People who are in a warm place love something cool.

This is the dilemma of life: Everyone is looking for perfect balance. Perfect balance is like a razor's edge. It can only be found in the self.

There is no road to this town and there are no steps to this house.

How do you get in? Figure it all out.

The big advanced course at the ashram of Kripalu Maharaj (the founder of Kripalu Yoga) at Kayavaran in India brought celebration to the ashram. It was all so well organized that there were no complaints and no one felt lost in the big group. There was one teacher taking care of every 25 people. People were sharing so many miraculous stories.

The outdoor Satsangs in the moon light and Christmas lights simply transformed the place into Brindavan. On the last evening, Guruji appeared in pink silks and was adorned with a crown of beautiful flowers and a peacock feather. Guruji received 400 garlands from devotees. Each garland that hung around Guruji's neck, when being removed took a few hairs with it.

This was a course that started in bliss and ended in chaos. Even though people thought there was no chaos, an impatient aeroplane left Guruji behind after the course, whereas the next plane in the next city and after a three-hour drive, graciously took Him and His group as the last passengers. The race did not end until He boarded His international connecting flight -- again as the last passenger . . .

NAVRATRI

Navratri means the nine nights and the new night. Creation happens in the darkness. In the womb of the mother and underneath the soil. Nine months in the womb are like nine long nights where the spirit takes human form.

Night provides rest and rejuvenation. At night the entire creation goes to sleep including the ashram night watchman. (Laughter) People working come home at night and they really celebrate, rejoice and pray. Nine nights are precious as they have subtle energy. The subtle is enriched.

There are 64 divine mother impulses which govern the subtle creation. These are responsible for restoring all earthly and spiritual benefits. They are simply part of one's awakened consciousness. These nine nights are celebrated to rekindle those divine impulses and celebrate the innermost depth of our lives.

Jai Guru Dev

Cleanse your body and cleanse your soul. Cleanse your body with water and your soul with knowledge and your spirit with pranayam and kriya. There is no penance higher than Pranayam. It is the greatest penance.

German Ashram had an intense Teachers Training Course. Guruji went up to Minsk and Belarus, where people had come from as far as Siberia. As many people met Guruji for the first time, it was like a dream come true for them. Virtually everybody had a miraculous experience to tell. One family had spent 7 months salary to come to meet Guruji. Another family sold their house to meet Gurudev. Over 1000 people filled the stadium and the auditorium looked splendid and all the teachers had worked hard to make the stadium look splendid and magnificent. People from Lithuania, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, and many other towns had gathered in a very festive mood. Russian television covered Guruji's arrival in Mumbai. There was a grand reception for Guruji. When he sat on his seat, all the flowers over him seemed to reach out for his Darshan. It seemed as if there was a waterfall of flowers and Guruji was smiling in the center. In the evening, Guruji was presented with two flowers, with which he played around for hours and kept posing for photographs. The conversation was diverted to the lotus flowers.

One who has given everything has also given freedom: Honor the freedom first and make good use of all things given to you.

Your sankalpas (intentions) and desires separate you from God.

Offer all the desires and your sankalpas to the Divine... then you are divine... you are God... you are free... lacking nothing.

Effort is the key in the relative,

Effortlessness is the key to the Absolute.

Your mind does not belong to you. Don't blame it.

SINCERITY AND BLESSINGS

Q: Many ask for blessings but only a few will receive it. Why?

A: The giver is anyway giving but the taker is not there - the sincerity is missing. One who gives blessings gives it freely but the one who receives it has to be sincere. Sincerity is the qualification to receive blessings. And everyone is free to be sincere at any point of time or space.

Q: Why do people choose to be sincere only sometimes?

A: Because of the illusion that they are going to miss some mundane pleasure. Hankering after pleasure makes them insincere. When you are sincere you simply enjoy pleasure.

Poor people fight for food. Rich people share their food. Richer are those people who share power. Richer still are those who share fame. Richest are those who share themselves. Richness of a person is indicated by his ability to share and not by what he hoards. Godliness is enjoying sharing fame.

"Sincerity is being in touch with your Depth."

The silence became alive with Vedic chantings. The saffron clad Swamis on either side of Guru Dev added luster to the gathering. The whole Ashram was so vibrant with Divine energy that the renowned pundits who had performed so many Yagyas felt the difference. As the Pundits became busier, the devotees became serene and still. The silence was thick and profound and the celebration was loud and colorful. And with each passing day Guru Dev grew younger and more radiant. Those who walked near Guru Dev's Kutir would experience different fragrances which kept changing every few minutes!

IN THE SOLITUDE OF THE SELF

Jai Guru Dev !

Buddha is not on the peak, rather the peak is beneath Buddha. One who goes to the peak comes down, but the peak seeks the one who is stationed in the inner space.

Shiva is called Chandrasekhara which means that mind which is in the Shiva (transcendence) and is always above the peak.

Often people are running after parties and celebrations, but for the one who is not running after them, parties and celebrations follow him. If you are running after parties, loneliness comes to you, but if you are in the solitude of the Self, parties surround you.

NEWS FLASH

The final day of Navaratri saw people, including children, transfixed in one place for nine hours. The energy was so overpowering that even the puja vessels started to vibrate. The chanting of the priests were framed by Indian clarinet and drums and the silence came aloud.

Guruji arrived in Bombay (Mumbai) for a last-minute-notice Satsang of hundreds of people which was wild with singing and celebration.

Satsangs and celebration moved on to Hong Kong where two lectures are happening in the beautiful Hong Kong Science Museum.

SEE THE DIVINE IN YOURSELF

You are stupid if you don't see the Divine in me.

If you see the Divine in me you cannot but be a part of me and you cannot be away from me. And if you feel a part of me you can only see the Divine in yourself. And if you can see the Divine in yourself, you'll see the Divine in everyone.

Art of Living Teachers have gone to Armenia on invitation of the United Nations to conduct a course for conflict resolution among the warring factions.

Sandy and party arrived in Japan where we had a wacky and wakening Satsang in Kobe. The party then proceeded to Tokyo where Tom, Chieko, Hydei and Nobuko had organised a lively discourse.

In Kyoto the Za-Zen Master of the Tofukuji Temple invited Guruji to his Monastery and had an interesting dialogue. He was touched by our presence.

Guruji was the Chairman of the International Conference of the Great Religions of Asia held at the Ryukoku University in Kyoto. Spiritual Leaders from around the World were present. There were many speakers but listeners felt stuffy and sleepy (laughter).

The press reporters were stunned by the changing fragrances experienced in Guruji's presence, but for those of us travelling with Guruji it was usual.

ANNIHILATE CONFLICT

When you are in a harmonious environment your mind picks up any excuse to be in conflict. So often small things are enough to create big turmoil. If you have a conflicting environment you tend to seek harmony ... Have you noticed this?

Ask yourself this question: Do you seek harmony in every situation or do you seek to widen the differences and prove your righteousness?

When your survival is at stake, you don't complain that nobody loves you. When you are safe and secure you start demanding attention. Many people create conflict in order to get attention.

The seed of negativity and the tendency for conflict in you can only be annihilated by Sadhana.

 

NEWS FLASH

In the Ashram some people wanted white bread to be served at breakfast. Some were opposed to this and it caused a big conflict (laughter) because they couldn't find any other reason to be in conflict. Just one phone call from Guruji set everyone in astonishment.

The diplomatic reception, the piles and piles of flower and the smiling crowd at the airport was a great part of the Taipei event. Guruji addressed a group of medical professionals in the afternoon and an interfaith conference attended by many religious leaders in the evening. An advanced course followed on the hilltop retreat center. The experiences of the people were great. One lady in her mid-thirties had been in a wheelchair and could not walk for several years. She started walking after she met Guruji on the previous advanced course. On the last day of the course, Sharmila and Guruji cooked for 20 volunteers who stayed back to clean up, and you know what? When dinner was served, 60 people showed up! All were fed with the food left over.

Amid tears and laughter the party moved

on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The honorable Minister for Works was present at the official launching of the Malaysian Art of Living Society. Several prominent leaders came to take blessings from Guruji. One of them asked, "What is the limit of want?" Guruji said, "Unhappiness." It was a colorful evening with Satsang and dinner. The lights of the local TV stations were so powerful that the circuit breakers switched off twice!

THE HEAT OF KNOWLEDGE

For your prayer to be answered, the desire has to be intense. The greater the intensity of desire and the later it gets fulfilled, then greater will be the gratitude.

lntense desire leads you to devotion. For desire to get intense, time and the need for the desire are required. The feeling of gratitude is so overwhelming after the fulfillment of desire that it's achievement loses its charm and significance.

The son of a farmer in India had a life-long desire to go to England and he prayed deeply for it. Even the news of his trip to England materializing filled him with immense gratitude -- he did not even care whether he went or not.

Often people think that they are unfortunate if their desires don't get fulfilled quickly. lntense desire can frustrate you or make you prayerful. In prayerfulness, there is gratitude and devotion. Any intense experience makes you whole.

Your consciousness is like corn. With the heat of Knowledge, consciousness pops ups and becomes white and fluffy.

NEWS FLASH

Guruji and his entourage moved from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. Once again the metal detector beeped. Guruji gave a fiery Satsang to a multi-ethnic audience. It has made teachers busy for the next whole month.

With Guruji's arrival, the City of Joy (Calcutta) was overjoyed. Hoardings and banners all over the city created a stampede at the magnificent GD Birla Sabhaghar city auditorium. But with the pervading bliss inside, everthing fell into place. The garden of Bharti and S.B. Ganguly was respendent with lights and melody -- The birds in the garden, the flowers, the decorations (not forgetting Bengali sweets), and smiling faces everywhere.

The pact of cooperation was signed by the Satsangees and the mosquitoes at the Nalban Park Salt Lake which was the venue for the next Satsang in Calcutta on the banks of the lake on a moonlit night. The team work at Calcutta that was in evidence all through was superlative.

THE ARROW OF FAITH

It is only through merit that you can have faith. When you lack faith, happiness is neither in the inner nor the outer world. Happiness springs forth from faith. Happiness is forgetting the body consciousness. Pain or sorrow is holding on to the body consciousness. Whenever you are happy you don't feel the body and when you are miserable, you have aches and pains.

Question: Then why in meditation is the attention taken to various parts of the body?

Guruji: For an arrow to go forward, you have to pull it back. In the same way when you take the attention to the various parts of the body, it frees you from body consciousness.

 

NEWS FLASH

Guruji's first whirlwind tour in the Punjab was exhilarating.

Joginder Sing, an 86 year old man, was color blind for the last 10 years and he regained his sense of colors. The world which was black and white once again became a color movie.

Mr. Sunif Gulati, the Director of the Government Dept of Health, had lost mobility of his neck due to an accident in 1984. Guruji casually put his hand on his neck and the next day, to his surprise, he gained back total mobility!

Another man, who had varicose veins and had an appointment for surgery, disappointed the surgeon because it was healed on the fourth day of the course.

During the Whole Life fair, Nityanand found a new style of introducing people to the course. Two gentlemen who came to our stall in the Whole Life fair asked of Nityanand, "What is this?"

Nityanand replied in rhythm, "Neither I know nor you, just sign up!"

The gentlemen, who were tired of listening to the lengthy explanations from all the other stalls, jumped up and said, "Wow! This is the real thing!". They signed up for the course!

HOW TO DEAL WITH RUDE BEHAVIOR

What do you do when someone behaves very rudely to you?

1. Get upset

2. React rudely back

3. Get frustrated

4. Run-away from and avoid the person or the situation

5. Blame the person

6. Preach to the person

None of these will in any way strengthen you.

Then what are the options? See rude behavior in this light:

1. It indicates the intensity of their commitment

2. It indicates the amount of stress and insensitivity

3. It projects the up-bringing of the person

4. It indicates a behavioral pattern

5. It shows lack of knowledge

6. It shows lack of observation of one's own mind and its sensations

7. It shows you behavior to avoid

8. It is an opportunity for you to welcome and absorb the rudeness

9. It strengthens your mind

10. It unconditions the love that you are

The next time when someone is rude to you, make sure you don't get upset. Just give back a broad smile.

If you can digest the rudeness, nothing whatsoever can shake you.

Guruji came from Delhi for an overnight stay at the Ashram and left the next morning to Kerala. Organizers in Delhi as well as in Cochin (Trivandrum and Trichur) had experienced very clearly the non-doership of the big event. Everything fell in its space at the right moment as always. Enthusiastic devotees in Cochin renovated their homes. After Cochin, Guruji rushed to the colorful Trichur (In Trichur as usual there was chaos and asana-snatch). Excellent team work and elaborate arrangements were appreciated by thousands who came to the Satsang. The Kerala-style decorated elephants with umbrellas and the ballkas dressed in traditional attire carrying lights and flowers were a spectacular welcome. Many people shared their amazing healing experiences. Then the whole troop moved to Trivandrum, the town of infinity. The king of Kerala received Guruji at the Senate Hall with a packed audience of 4000 people. Colorful umbrellas, elephants, the traditional horns and drums and the Vedic chanting filled the air. People were enraptured for a three and a half hour program. The next morning newspapers were filled with the news of the Art of Living Satsang.

PLEASURE

The mind that is seeking pleasure cannot be centered. You either seek pleasure or come to me. When you are centered, all pleasures come to you anyway, but they are no longer pleasures. They lose their charm. The mind that seeks pleasure can never achieve the highest. If you are after pleasure, forget about Satsang. Why are you wasting your time? This is the Art of Living.

If you are enjoying your suffering, then you also cannot be centered and you are far away from the path.

 

 

Susannah: What do you do when people talk negatively about this organization, Satsangs, teachers, or anybody for that matter?

Guruji: From your side give license to everybody to talk about anything, about anybody, anywhere, at any time.

Exercise -- Talk maximum negativity about everybody this whole week. This is a challenge.

Murli had a severe allergy. He could not talk and he could hardly eat or drink. His tongue was swollen. It was an alarming condition. Then Guruji arrived. He told Murli to take some medicine and tapped him on the throat. Amazingly, Murli was cured in the next few minutes. It was as though nothing had happened. He did not listen to Guruji. He did not even take any medicine.

People came to the Advanced Course for silence and were blasted by loud raucous music from the local village. People came all the way from Germany for the sunny weather for which Bangalore is known at this time of the year. They got dreary clouds, chilling wind, and rain. In addition, there were frequent power cuts which ensured that people took cold water baths in the morning. GurujiÒ³ voice went hoarse and He needed a tap on His own throat!

THE FIVE ASPECTS OF THE UNIVERSE

You have five aspects to yourself: Asti (is-ness); Bhaati (Knowledge, expression); Preeti (love); Nama (name); and Rupa (form).

Matter has two aspects: name and form.

Consciousness has three aspects: "is-ness" - that it is; knowingness/expression - it knows and expresses; and love - it is loving.

This is the secret of the whole universe.

Maya is not being aware of the three aspects of consciousness. Ignorance is when one is caught up in the name and form.

Question: Why are we imperfect?

Answer: So that we can grow to perfection. Life is a movement from imperfection to perfection. A seed contains the tree but the seed has to cease to be a seed to become a tree. The seed is not perfect. The sapling is not perfect. It has to cease to be a sapling to become a tree. So in life you can either see imperfection at every step, or you can see a movement from one perfection to another perfection.

Wherever you put your attention then that will grow. If you put your attention on the lack of something, the lack will increase.

SURRENDER AND SELF-RELIANCE

Self-reliance needs enormous courage.

Surrender needs less courage.

A person who cannot surrender cannot be self-reliant either.

If you don't have enough courage to surrender, then it is impossible for you to be self-reliant. You simply fool yourself. People who are afraid to surrender fool themselves. Because even a little fear is detrimental to self-reliance.

If you don't have a hundred dollars, you cannot have a thousand dollars.

Self-reliance contains surrender. Fifty dollars contains ten dollars.

Question: Why does self-reliance need so much courage?

When you want to depend on yourself for everything, there is nobody else, then it needs a lot of courage.

Often people think that surrender is a way to escape from responsibility and they end up blaming the Divine for all their problems. In fact, the true surrender is taking total responsibility for everything.

Susannah: How can we do that?

You take responsibility and you pray for help.

Surrender eventually leads you to self-reliance. Because there is nothing other than the Big Self.

A Madras satsang of 3500 people served as a farewell party for Guruji on the eve of his departure from India. It was held in a gigantic marble hall; and a choir of seventy school girls serenaded Guruji with well-rehearsed and enthusiastic bhajans. An entourage of forty-five devotees traveled from Bangalore to Madras for the occasion.

India's warm December weather, bougainvillea and coconut palms have now been replaced by Switzerland's mist-shrouded Alpine peaks, snow-covered palms, and the swans on Lake Lucerne.

Today is Christmas, and appropriately all the course participants have gone into silence this morning to celebrate in a deep and authentic way.

Whatever the world needs or wants, you are there for that. So the year is fortunate that you are on the earth at this point in time.

PADMANABHA -- THE LOTUS NAVEL

Different organs of our body are governed by different devas. The solar plexus is connected with the sun, that's why it is called "solar" plexus. When the first rays of the sun fall on the solar plexus, it is very good for your body. Doing Surya Namaskar ("sun salutation") yoga asana in the early morning is very good. The solar plexus has a profound impact on the central nervous system, optic nerves, stomach, and what we usually call "gut feeling." It is the second brain in your body. Usually the solar plexus is slightly bigger than an almond. Studies have shown that with the practice of yoga, meditation, and Sudarshan Kriya, the solar plexus can become as a large as the size of the palm. Then it performs better. It balances the body functions. When the solar plexus expands, the intuitive mind works better. The mind becomes clear and focussed. When the solar plexus contracts, one feels horrible, sad, depressed, and all the negative feelings come.

Krishna was called Padmanabha, meaning "whose navel is the size of a lotus flower." If you become Padmanabha, you become absolutely creative. Brahma, the Creator, is born out of a blossomed solar plexus.

These days, the solar plexus remains small, but the tummy keeps getting bigger.

BHAKTI

In Bhakti there are four letters. It's made up of "bha", "ka", "ta", and "i" (ee). "Bha" stands for fulfillment and nourishment. "Ka" stands for knowing - a means of knowing. "Ta" stands for redeeming, for saving, for salvation. "I" (ee) stands for shakti.

So in Bhakti four things are there: fulfillment and nourishment; means of knowing; "tarana" or salvation; and energy. Bhakti saves you. Bhakti nourishes you. Bhakti is the means of knowing, the right knowledge. When Bhakti is there the doubts don't come. It gives the most energy. So Bhakti contains as the seed all the four qualities.

All the emotional upheavals one undergoes is because one doesn't know Bhakti. When all intense feelings flow in one direction that is Bhakti, it becomes Bhakti. What is the difference between a canal and a flooded field? In a flood what happens is the water does not have a bank to flow in. When the water flows within banks you call it "river". When water is scattered all over, it's all flooded. So when the emotions get flooded everywhere, mind is in a mess. If it is intensely flowing in a direction, then that is Bhakti. And that is most powerful.

A sign of Intelligence is Surrender or Bhakti.

ACCEPT THE WORLD AT ITS WORST

Suppose the worst of the world is given to you; what would you do with it now? You cannot complain if you get the worst. You can only complain if you don't get the worst. If the world is at its worst, then it can only get better and you are here to make it better.

Jim: When things are at their very worst, then there is only time and space. (Laughter)

Patty: When you see that life is suffering then you go within.

Paula: It is like running out of breath and you have to inhale.

What happens when you have to do it all by yourself -- no one comes to help? You do everything by yourself?

There are three options:

Frustration and complaining.
Take credit that you did it by yourself -- thank others for not helping so that you could take all the credit. (Laughter)
Be grateful, pray deeply, and know that you get all the energy needed to do it all alone. There is only one doer.
NEWS FLASH Guruji's party made a lightening tour to Dominica and there was a program organized by the cabinet minister for education and social welfare. The Satsang group met in the airport VIP lounge on the way back during a stop over in St. Lucia (a Caribbean island). There was a diplomatic reception in Curacao (another island near Venezuela) and a big Satsang. For the first public talk there was a full house. On to Panama, where Martine and Dr. Chu hosted a large Satsang and then Shirley was the copilot of the small plane that took the group to the Panama Canal. Manu, from Hong Kong, is organizing courses all over Central and South America. Marjorie and her team organized a packed house for a great talk in Costa Rica. This trip gave a huge boost to the spreading of the knowledge throughout the Caribbean and Central America.

Short story: Guruji was walking along the beach with some devotees and there was a huge desalination plant (changes salt water to fresh water) costing millions of dollars. Nearby was a coconut tree. Guruji looked and pointed out that the tree is a natural desalination plant. It takes the salt water from the earth and makes the fresh water inside the coconut. The knowledge is like the tree -- it takes us from salty mud to the pure bliss.

INDIGESTION OF KNOWLEDGE

Indigestion of knowledge leads to development of a false ego which has no cure. Knowledge must be digested properly.

Indigestion of knowledge leads to:

False ego
Disinterestedness; taking for granted; lack of awareness
Familiarity without understanding, without depth -- flakiness
Tendency to preach
"Heart" burn
Using knowledge for their own small ends
Adamancy
Your inability to do something (break a habit) can cause a pinch; when you are deeply pained by something, then that will rid you of that habit. If you are pained by your shortcomings, then you are sadhak. Pain takes you out of addiction.

If you are in love with the divine, then you can digest the knowledge. Love is the appetizer -- seva is the exercise -- without love and seva, knowledge becomes indigestible. So everyone list the loving seva you have done for the world.

Marielle: If love is the appetizer, what is the main course?

Guruji: Knowledge

Daniel: What is dessert?

BE LOVED

You don't need to worry to maintain knowledge. When knowledge is lodged in you as wisdom, it will never leave you. Wisdom lodges itself in your heart. Make the Divine your Valentine (your sweet Beloved). This is the last thing to do and the first thing to do. Keep your heart in a safe place; it is too delicate. Events, small things make strong impressions on it. And you cannot find a better place than the Divine to keep your heart safe and your mind sane. When you keep your heart in the Divine, the moving time, the passing events, will not be able to touch it, will not create a scar. A precious stone needs a setting around it, gold or silver, to hold it and to wear it; so wisdom and knowledge are that setting around the heart which will hold it in the Divine.

See the Divine in your Valentine and make the Divinity your Valentine (your sweet beloved). Just BE. . .and know that you are LOVED... That is BELOVED.

When you do seva don't think you are doing a favor for somebody. You have done the seva and it has rewarded you immediately. Its reward is for sure and is always more than your doing. Your expectation of reward for the seva turns the seva into labor. If you think you have done a lot, you will do very little; if you see you have done a little, then you will do more. Seva is even when you don't see an immediate reward there is no complaint; labor is even after an immediate reward, there will be complaints. Be grateful for any opportunity to do the seva.

Angels are a part of the Big Self. The infinity has diverse qualities, and specific qualities assume names. They are called Angels. Angels are nothing but a ray of your Big Self. They are there to serve you when you are centered. Like roots and stems and leaves come out of a seed when it is sprouted, all the Angels in your life manifest when you are centered. Angels rejoice in your company, but you have nothing to gain from them. They only come around those who have nothing to gain from them. Angels are like your extended arms. Like all the colors are present in the white sunlight, all the Angels are present in your higher self. Bliss is their breath, dispassion their abode. The consciousness which is bliss, innocence, omnipresent, and the bestower of dispassion is Shiva. Krishna is the outer manifestation of Shiva. And Shiva is the inner silence of Krishna.

This experience brought a depth and dispassion in the entire group, and they celebrated singing Jai Jai Radha Ramana Hari Bol . In death, as in life, Guruji was right there at the helm of everything. The entire family will be joining Guruji in Rishikesh.

Then on to Delhi, the spiritually saturated capital of India, where billboards were seen at every major intersection. The thrilling Satsang and meditation captivated the thousands present.

A FRIEND IS AN ENEMY AND AN ENEMY IS A FRIEND

In the company of your friends, you lose your centeredness. Your enemy puts you back in yourself. Your friend sympathizes with you and makes you believe in matter. Your enemy makes you feel helpless and takes you to the spirit. So your enemy is your friend and your friend is your enemy!

Krishna said to Arjuna: One who is unfriendly everywhere (including himself); his consciousness is stable and awareness is established.

NEWS FLASH:

The residents of Rishikesh experienced the first rain in several months on the day Guruji arrived! Teachers from all over India have arrived for their annual meeting and refresher. Guruji is using this temporary respite to go through mountains of mail!

A team of doctors conducted a free medical camp in Urugalli, Karnataka, where over 2500 villagers were given diagnoses and medicines.

From four die-hard devotees rapidly recovering from a traffic accident from buoyant BARODA :

Thanks to Guruji's incredible grace and the loving seva of Baroda Satsangees, we are all strong and rejoicing. There is life on earth and life after death. For one brief moment, we were blessed with the vision of both. Now we are truly celebrating this life - its pain, humor, chaos and joy in total gratitude and surrender to the Divine.

SIMPLE OR COMPLEX?

Life is utterly simple and yet most complex. You have to simultaneously attend to both facets of life. When life appears most complex, turn to the simplicity. Simplicity brings peace. When you are peaceful attend to the complexity within you. That will make you more skillful.

If you are only with simplicity, it makes you lazy and dull. Being only with complexity makes you angry and frustrated. The intelligent ones balance them and rejoice in both. If you look only to simplicity, growth is not there. Looking only at the complexity, there is no life at all. All that you need is a skillful balance. If you recognize both simplicity and complexity of life, you will be skillfully peaceful!

Colors are the complexity of life. White is the simplicity. When your heart is pure, your life becomes so colorful.

Vikram: Guruji, you are all white and yet so colorful.

Pramila: Like our knowledge, which is so profound and yet so simple!

EXPAND YOUR VICES

If you cannot get rid of vices, increase them. Worry, pride, anger, lust, grief - give them a bigger dimension and a different direction. Anger - what is the point of getting angry about small events? Be angry about the infinite, about Brahma.

Ego, pride - If you cannot get rid of pride, take pride in owning THE DIVINE.

Greed - Be greedy for SATSANG.

Craving - Crave for truth.

Aversion - Be averse to aversions.

Jealousy - Be jealous about SEVA.

Intoxication - Get intoxicated in the DIVINE.

Attachment - Attach yourself to the guru.

Joy is love for what is. Sorrow is love for what is not.

THE PRIMAL INSTINCT

Fear is an impression of the past reflecting about the future of the present. When people deny fear, they become egocentric, when they recognize and accept fear, they go beyond...get free from it.

Total lack of fear is possible only in utter chaos or utmost orderliness. A saint or a fool have no fear. But everywhere in between there is fear. Fear is essential to preserve orderliness in the world. It is a primal instinct.

FEAR OF DEATH PRESERVES LIFE.

FEAR OF WRONG KEEPS THE RIGHT.

FEAR OF SICKNESS BRINGS HYGIENE.

FEAR OF MISERY KEEPS YOU RIGHTEOUS.

A CHILD HAS A PINCH OF FEAR SO IT IS CAREFUL AND ALERT WHILE WALKING. A PINCH OF FEAR IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THINGS MOVING SMOOTHLY.

Because fear is love standing upside down, everything that can be interpreted with Love can also be interpreted with fear. For example, a child clinging onto its mother. This can be interpreted in both ways - out of Love or out of Fear.

This primal instinct can be totally transformed through Awareness of Divine Love.

Do not try to eliminate fear. Just meditate and know that you are nobody or that you belong to someone special...

NEWS FLASH:

Once again on the banks of the Ganga, the sublime Knowledge of the Ashtavakra Gita and the Narada Bhakti Sutras flowed in Hindi from the source.

SATSANG IS THE SHELTER

Why do people need homes? Can they live like animals in the forest without shelter? Even intelligent animals make their homes. Man needs protection from changing nature. So he builds a shelter for physical comforts. In the same way, for spiritual and mental comfort - Satsang is the shelter.

One who does not do Satsang is like a wild animal. Satsang alone makes one civilized. Satsang is the shelter from the changing times and its harsh influence on life.

Satsang is the nest in which you can rest.

If you are a taker of happiness, you get misery.

If you are a giver of happiness, you get joy and love.

NEWS FLASH:

As the month long stay in Rishikesh came to an end, many saints of the region came to greet Guruji and blessed the Art of Living family and wished he could stay there longer.

Enthusiastic devotees in Delhi had a farewell Satsang as the party boarded the flight to the East - to the City of Joy.

The big hoardings all over Calcutta attracted a big crowd and the Satsang was wonderful!

THREE KINDS OF LOVE

There are three kinds of Love. The Love that comes out of Charm, that which comes out of comfort, and the Divine Love. Do you see what I am saying?

The love that comes out of charm does not last long. It comes out of unfamiliarity or out

of attraction. In this you lose the attraction fast, and boredom sets in, like most love marriages. This love may diminish and bring along with it fear, uncertainty, insecurity, and sadness.

The Love that comes out of comfort and familiarity grows. But this Love has no thrill, no enthusiasm, joy, or fire to it. For example, you are more comfortable with an old friend who is a familiar person, rather than with a new person.

The Divine Love supersedes both the above. The Divine Love has ever newness. The closer you go, there is more charm and depth. The Divine Love has comfort, enthusiasm, and familiarity. There is never boredom and it keeps everyone on their toes.

Worldly love can be like an ocean, yet an ocean has a bottom. The Divine Love is like the sky which is limitless, infinite. From the bottom of the Ocean, soar into the vast sky.

Anything more about Divine Love? Refer to our Bhakti Sutras.

NEWS FLASH:

During a visit to Adichunchunagiri Ashram, Guruji said that this devotees are waiting for him and he must return soon. "No, let them wait. Waiting for the Guru is tapas (penance). Waiting for the world is tapa (torture)," replied the Swamiji of that ashram.

In the northeastern region at Guwahati, the jubilant crowd of the generally conservative and closed society turned limitlessly wild. An elaborate banquet for 1500 devotees followed the Satsang. Four buses and twelve cars with 180 devotees, left for Shillong, the Meghalayan Capital also called "The Scotland of the East." En route, the devotees stopped for a picnic on the banks of a large lake and for rides on a speed boat. All the satsangees of Shillong behaved like an old bunch, though they were meeting Guruji for the first time. On his return, Calcutta had a Mega Satsang in the Science city auditorium.

P.S. Guruji has now arrived in Bangalore. Sukha Nadi (5,000 year old palm leaf scripture) mentioned Guruji's name and that he is the incarnation of Lord Krishna. There is a temple of Mother Divine 300 km from the Ashram. The idol of this deity writes and answers questions of devotees. This deity visited our Ashram and She "wrote" that she was extremely happy about the work of our Ashram. She also "wrote" that the spirits of both Lord Krishna and the Mother Divine reside in Guruji. She also "wrote" that all Guruji's devotees are in the most right path and are peaceful, calm, and settled.

WHAT ENHANCES YOUR BEAUTY?

 

When your mind is not complaining, responsible, courageous, confident and hollow and empty you are inexplicably beautiful. A person who cannot correct or act has no right to complain. And when a person can correct or act, he will never complain. Complaining is a sign of weakness. Complaining is the nature of utter ignorance where one does not know the Self. Complaint takes away the Beauty that is inborn in you. And it shows up more on the one who is on this path.

Worldly mind is a complaining mind; Divine mind is a dancing mind. Just complaining without indicating the solution is irresponsibility. When the solutions are not workable, finding alternative solutions is Courage.

For external beauty, you put on things; for real Beauty, you have to drop all the things. For external beauty you have to have Make-up; for your real Beauty you only have to realise that you are MADE-UP!

NEWS FLASH:

Public Satsangs were thronged by thousands and cable networks broadcast it live. Construction activities and an ART Excel course for children are in full swing. Home for the homeless and sanitation facilities for the surrounding villages is the new Seva Project started by Guruji. Already 15 houses are coming up fast.

Those who are living in the present and who tell others to live in the present are busy planning. But the plans of the Singaporeans were toppled by Guruji by not arriving there as scheduled. What a Game!!!

DROP YOUR SELF IMAGE

Kashiap : "How do you make everyone happy?"
Guruji : "Become me."
Rama : "How do we become you?"

What stands between you and me is your self image. Your self image restricts you from being me. Self image whether good or bad causes misery.

When you think good about yourself in a very subtle manner you think bad about others. Then anger, jealousy, hatred - everything follows.

When you think bad about yourself you feel low and again you start getting angry and you hate everyone else. If you think good about yourself you are in trouble and when you think bad about yourself you are in greater trouble.

So drop your self image.

NEWS FLASH:

The Malaysian Advanced Course ended on Sunday and the celebration moved on to Mauritius for the first time. Though preparations for the first visit were on for weeks, all the jigsaw puzzles came to place in the last moment.

Three grand Satsangs were held with packed halls. The Prime Minister and many Cabinet Ministers also came for the blessings from Guruji.

It took 200 top police officers and the Commissioner of Police to capture Guruji at the Police Headquarters. The officers all in uniforms were mesmerized by Guruji. They ended up singing bhajans and came to hug and get the blessings from the Master. Many promised to join the Art of Living Satsang group. One of the police officers remarked to Sharda that Guruji is a "stress breaker" but for Sharda and others Guruji is rather a "heart breaker".

Remember that May 13 is Guruj's 41st Birthday! We should start an annual tradition based on last year's birthday surprise which Guruji really liked. At pre-dawn in India (6 to 7 pm U.S. East coast time), we should all join together in silence and meditation to celebrate the incarnation of Grace on this planet. I (Bill Hayden) would like to recommend a Birthday present dear to our Master's heart. We should see how many Dollar-a-Day children that our local communities can support between May 13 and Gurupurnima. We can present this gift to Him at the Gurupurnima celebration.

THE WORLD BELONGS TO YOU

Pleasure or pain is an intense sensation in the 4 to 6  foot body. When we are not caught up in this then we are truly and sincerely able to say, "I belong to you." That is when all the cravings and aversions, desires and doubts fall off -- and in a moment the world belongs to you. All your miseries surround the "I, I, I, . . . ", "I want this, I like that, I don't like this . . ." Just let go. The sun rises and sets, the grass grows, the river flows, the moon shines and I am here forever!

How do you feel if someone praises you?

Answer: "Shy, happy, great, embarrassed . . . "

It does something to you, doesn't it? It doesn't do anything to me! When you praise the moon, the mountains, Lake Lucerne, the Black Forest . . .it doesn't do anything to them. They remain the same.

Just like that I am part of nature. If you enjoy praising me, you may do so. In fact, you have no choice! (Laughter)

You can do with me whatever you like. I am there for you. I am your toy! (Laughter)

NEWS FLASH:

Time literally stood still in Mauritius. In Satish's house where Guruji stayed, all six clocks and everybody's watches mysteriously stopped! But anyway, Guruji moved on to South Africa where he addressed enthusiastic crowds in Pretoria and Johannesburg. Then on to Botswana where Guruji was received by the President at the State House. Later, Guruji visited a Government Hospital and distributed toys and gifts of clothes and food to the ailing children in the pediatric ward. The children loved it! It was Santa Claus but with a black beard and trim tummy! Guruji distributed blankets and food to the aged and disabled of the entire village of Modipane. The people were overwhelmed and greeted Guruji with joy and cheer. Enthusiastic devotees of Botswana's Art of Living are organizing big basic courses and great satsangs. The tired group went on an African Safari and found two leopards, five elephants, a vulture with a broken wing, and two monkeys! The only enthusiastic person was the guide. The giggling gang went on and on. Joy knew no bounds and people were forgetting traffic rules as usual. Hema spooned hot pickle into her tea instead of sugar!

The Ahmedabad chapter organized a blood donation camp and Bangalore organized a mass feeding of the poor. And in Bad Antogast there was a five story birthday cake with marzipan swans.

Instead of "How are you?" Guruji greeted everyone with "How am I?"

DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT

Just like you run out of fuel in the car and you have to refill it again and again, in the same way your dedication and commitment runs out in the course of time and it needs constant renewal!

You have to dedicate and rededicate again and again.

Often people take their dedication for granted and then the mind starts demanding or complaining. When dedication is not complete, it leads to grumbling and complaints.

Total dedication brings enormous enthusiasm, zeal, trust, and challenge, and does not leave any room for ego.

NEWS FLASH:

Spring was in full swing in Bad Antogast (German Ashram). As it was in nature, so it was in all the hearts.

The first silent seeds were sown in Austria. A bus full of devotees came all way from Croatia driving for eight to ten hours to meet Guruiji for just a couple of hours in Vienna.

Today's full moon is dedicated to Buddha and now it is time to rededicate oneself.

THE WAY OUT OF SORROW

If your are unhappy you better check if one or all of these are lacking: Tapa (penance), Vairagya (dispassion), Sharanagati (surrender).

- Tapas is agreeing with the moment, total acceptance of pleasant or unpleasant situations.

- Vairagya means I want nothing and I am nothing.

- Sharanagati is "I am here for You, for Your joy."

If you are grumbling then these are lacking, because when you accept the situation you cannot grumble; when you take it as Tapa you will not grumble; when you come from a state dispassion ("I don't want anything") you don't grumble; and if you are surrendered you will have no complaints.

All these three (Tapas, Vairagya and surrender) purify your mind and uplift you in joy.

If you donÒ´ do it willingly you will do it in desperation. First you say, "Nothing can be done." Then in anger and desperation you say, "I give up, I want nothing, I have no choice, to hell with it!"

On Buddha Purnima, Guruji was engrossed in singing a new bhajan and did not go to the lecture in Innsbruck. Though the next day he surprised the unhappy organizer and made her happy.

THE DIVINE BEYOND TIME

An ignorant person either disbelieves or believes the individual. The wise neither disbelieves nor believes the individual. His faith rests on Kala (time). When the time is good, a foe will behave like a friend. When the time is not good, even a friend will behave like a foe. The wiser one believes in Mahakala (the Grand time or Shiva). An ignorant person disbelieves in time and the Divine beyond time.

In the world and in time there is always room for improvement. You can improve your time and your nature. Only the Being is perfect all the time. Take refuge in the Being and become incorrigible.

"I am" incorrigible.

NEWS FLASH:

The discovery of the week is that Guruji has a three piece suit and a mobile phone! Guruji always has a three piece suit (Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh) and only one suit case!

The miracle of the week is that the angry, reluctant and uncooperative driver of the "Tour de France" bus has become friendly and very patient with the Art of Living circus. A big transformation has occurred in him by just being with the group. Now he believes that Guruji is more successful than president Chirac.

His only puzzle was that whatever Guruji said was so correct, yet the people in the bus were so different.

The joke of the week is that by the end of the tour, he started serving us to such an extent that he forgot his own baggage. The Tour de France gave a big boost to the AoL France. The advanced course has begun in a beautiful Zen temple.

EVERY STONE IS PRECIOUS

A sculptor in a temple uses all types of stones.

Certain stones he uses for the foundations. These never appear outside.

From certain stones which are good to carve, the sculptor makes the walls and pillars of the Temple.

From other stones he makes the steps.

Certain stones become the tower of the Temple.

Only those stones which are extremely suitable for carving will become the Deity and be installed in the Temple.

When the stone become a part of the Temple, it no longer remains a stone, it becomes a sculpture, a piece of art, it becomes the Living Deity.

In the same way many people come to the Master. According to the degree of their surrender they are installed by the Master.

All are essential.

If there were no steps, how could a person reach the Temple?

If there were no foundation, how could the Temple be there at all?

What can a tower do without pillars?

For a sculptor, each stone is precious and valuable.

SENSITIVITY AND STRENGTH

Those who are sensitive often feel weak. Those who feel strong are often insensitive.

Some people are sensitive to themselves but insensitive to others . They often feel the others are "bad guys."

Those who are sensitive to others but not to themselves often end up feeling Poor me.

Some conclude it's better not to be sensitive ,because sensitivity brings pain. They shut off .But mind you , if you are not sensitive, you will lose all the finer things in life, too--intuition, beauty and ecstasy of love.

Insensitive people usually do not recognize their weakness .And those who are sensitive do not recognize that their sensitivity is their strength .

This path and this Knowledge make you strong and sensitive .

Sensitivity is intuition .Sensitivity is compassion . Sensitivity is love .Sensitivity is real strength: calmness , endurance ,silence ,non-reactiveness ,confidence ,faith --and a smile.
Be both sensitive and strong.

THE PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL

How can we reconcile the impersonal with the personal?

In love you raise the object to life. When you love an object it becomes life. For children everything is personal. Children take each object they play with and make it totally personal. Even a stone has a face; even the sun laughs. When you attach emotion, the whole creation becomes personal. When you remove the emotion, even people become objects. Violence is removing the emotion. How a person can kill another person: it is when they do not see them as a person, they see them as an object. But even a stone attracts reverence when it becomes personal.

Dean says: In military training they teach soldiers to see people as killing objects coming toward you that need to be killed first.

Susannah says: In the temple even a stone is elevated to the level of spirit.

The impersonal cannot attract reverence. Most people see God as impersonal and therefore they do not progress.

Dean and Susannah say: "That's why we need a Guru!"

Chan says: When we say something isn't real, then it's impersonal. When we personalize

something, we make it real. So then, what is reality?

You are the Reality. You are not the thoughts, you are not the emotions nor actions. You are not even a person...!

Exercise: What you now see as impersonal, see it as personal. And when you feel any negative emotion towards anybody, see them as impersonal. And pretend that you yourself are a robot.

THE GOLDEN VEIL

Craving comes from encouraging the thought of pleasure.

The actual experience of pleasure may not be as pleasurable as the memory.

Georgia: That 's why we spend so much time in our minds!

Whether you encourage a worldly thought or a Divine thought, they both bring you pleasure. Worldly thought leads to indulgence, which brings you down from pleasure to disappointment and dejection. Divine thought takes you up from pleasure to Bliss, Intelligence, and progress in life. Worldly thought brings pleasure only as memory, whereas Divine thought comes as Reality.

Question: What is a Divine thought?

"I am not the body; I am bliss, satchitananda; I am unbounded space; I am love; I am peace; I am light."

Question: What is a worldly thought?

It is about money, sex, food, power, status and self-image.

Truth is hidden by the golden veil of the mundane.

Pierce through the glittering sheath and know you are the Sun.

P.S. In the world everybody is after GOLD; some are after GOOD; but only a few are after GOD. Transcend GOLD, transcend the GOOD, and reach GOD.

With Whom Are You At Ease?

With whom do you feel really comfortable and at ease?

You feel comfortable with someone who does not question your love, someone who takes for granted that you love them. Isn't it?

If someone doubts your love and you constantly have to prove it, this becomes a heavy load on your head.

When someone doubts your love, they start questioning you and demanding explanations for all your actions.

To explain everything you do is a burden. Your nature is to shed the burden, and so you don't feel comfortable.

When you question the reason behind an action, you are asking for justice for yourself. You are creating a distance when you ask for justice. Your whole intention is to come close, but you are creating a distance.

You are a witness to all your actions. You are as much a stranger to your own actions as you are to someone else's. You are the Eternal Witness.

When someone asks for an explanation, they are speaking from doership and imposing that doership on you. This brings discomfort.

If somebody is just there with you, like a part of you, they don't question you. They are like your arm. There is thorough understanding and questions don't arise.

Neither demand an explanation nor give an explanation.

The big frogs have come back from the big pond to the small pond!! Pitaji has arrived in North America for the first time, and we are greatly enjoying his stories from the Puranas.

Let love be. Don't give it a name. When you give it a name it becomes a relationship, and relationship restricts love.

There is love between you and me. Just let it be. If you name love, for example, brother, sister, mother, father, guru, you are making it into a relationship. Relationship restricts love. Let love be. DonÒ´ give it a name.

Often what is universal is not personal and what is personal does not belong to everyone. What is "mine" and what is "universal" are completely opposite. This is the cause of greed, fear, jealousy, and lack of contentment. On this Guru Purnima wake up and realize that the Lord of the Universe is very personal to you. Your personal Guru is the Guru of the whole world. The Guru is your very SELF and your SELF is the very life in every being. Make the universal personal; it makes you richer, wiser, stronger. Make the personal universal; you will find freedom, compassion, love.

Jai Guru Dev

On Respect

Question: What do you do if people don't respect you?

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: Thank them. They have given you freedom. (Laughter and amazement) When people respect you, they often take away your freedom. They expect you to smile at them, recognize them, behave in a certain way with them.

If they don't respect you, you are not obliged to answer their questions and you can drop all the formalities. Either you will be naturally smiling or frowning. So you will be complete.

When people love and respect you, you are obliged to return their courtesies because you don't want to hurt them. When they don't respect or love you, they will not be hurt by your actions and expressions. So they set you free.

When you gain respect, you often do it at the cost of your freedom. Wisdom is to put the freedom first and not bother about respect.

Q: Will freedom not bring arrogance?

A: True freedom is not an "I don't care" attitude. It is lightness from within, a genuine smile and not stiffness.

When someone is stiff and arrogant, they are not really free. True love blossoms only in such freedom.

And when there is genuine love, respect simply follows you.

Midway through the Art Excel Course at Lake Tahoe, the teenagers staged a 'rebellion' against the course teachers.

Sacrifice

Sacrifice is letting go of something that you are holding on to or are attached to, which gives you pleasure, for something bigger that would bring good.

Sacrifice brings strength in life. Life without sacrifice is stagnant. Sacrifice gives you the quantum leap. It takes you to a higher pedestal.

Often people think sacrifice makes life dull and joyless. In fact, it is the sacrifice which makes life worth living.

The amount of sacrifice in your life brings out your magnanimity and helps you move out of misery.

A life without sacrifice is worth nothing. Zeal, enthusiasm, strength and joy are all connected to sacrifice.

Question: Some people say, "I have sacrificed so much," and complain.

Answer: That is good. The thought of sacrifice has given them strength to complain and saves them from blaming themselves without which they would even be more depressed.

Sacrifice never goes unrewarded.

There can be no love, no wisdom and no true joy without sacrifice.

SACRIFICE MAKES YOU SACRED. Become sacred!

There was an article in the Moscow Times saying that the fighting factions had agreed to stop fighting only two weeks after our team started work there. This was reported in the newspapers and television shows.

Window Shutters

To the degree that you are awake, everything around you brings you knowledge. If you are not awake, then even the most precious knowledge does not make any sense.

(Suddenly there was much noise from outside and Kiran went to shut the window.)

Sri Sri: Awareness depends upon your ability to shut your windows. When there is a storm you need to shut your windows, otherwise you will get wet.

When it is hot and suffocating inside, you need to open your windows. Your senses are like the windows. When you have the ability to open and shut your windows at your will then you are free and you are awake. When your windows cannot be shut or opened, you are bound.

Attending to that is sadhana or practice.

NEWS FLASH

In Stockholm, far more people came for the evening program than could be accommodated. Guruji first went and greeted those who could not get into the auditorium. The last comes first!

RAKSHA BANDHAN

This full moon is dedicated to the seers -- the rishis. It is also called the raksha bandhan. Bandhan means bondage, raksha means protection. A bondage that protects you. Your bondage to the knowledge, to the master, to the truth, To The Self, All Saves You. A Rope Can Be Tied To Either Protect Or Strangle You. The Small Mind And Mundane Things can strangle you. The big mind or knowledge saves you. Raksha bandhan is that bondage that saves you.

You are bound by your bondage to the satsang. Your bondage to the master, to the truth, to the ancient knowledge of the rishis is your savior.

Bonding is essential in life. And let the bonding be divine in a life free from bondage.

Question: Who is an atheist?

Answer: One who has a concept of God.

Question: What is peace?

Answer: Undivided mind.

TRUTH ONCE FOUND

It is the intellect that divides and that synthesizes. Some creatures in the world only synthesize and some creatures only divide. But the human being has both abilities, he divides and synthesizes. Ants only synthesize, they bring Things Together And Build An Ant Hill. But Monkeys Cannot Synthesize, They Can Only Divide Everything. You Give Them a garland for example, and they tear it to pieces and throw it all over the place. A monkey can only divide, or analyze. But a beaver synthesizes, it brings all the wood together and builds a dam. Birds also synthesize such as the Weaver birds.

A human being both analyzes and synthesizes. So you analyze from the relative world and synthesize to find the one. The intellect divides to find the truth. Truth once found synthesizes everything.

When the intellect becomes quiet, it brings out the intelligence. Often people think that gathering information makes one intelligent. This is not so. It is the "samadhi" which brings out the intelligence.

An unintelligent man, in spite of having all the information, cannot be creative. An intelligent man without much information can be creative.

A sign of intelligence is to see the one in many and find the many in one.

There is an old Sanskrit proverb: The first sign of intelligence is not to start anything. The second sign of intelligence is if you have started something, you have to continue it to the end.

If you have annoyed somebody, don't stop it in the middle, take him to the edge. (Laughter)

THE BIG DILEMMA

If there is complete faith, then there are no questions. If you don't have any faith then there is no point in asking any questions because how can there be any faith in the answer that is given?

Harish : What About The Questions That We Ask With Complete Faith?

Sri Sri : If you have faith in God or yourself or your family and friends then questions cannot arise. When you know somebody is taking care of you, what is the need to ask any question? For example, if you have taken the Karnataka Express to Bangalore, then there is no need to ask at every station "Where is the train going?". When there is someone to take care of your desire, then why go to an astrologer?

Rajesh : But what about blind faith?

Sri Sri : Faith is faith...it cannot be blind. When you call it blind it is not faith - at least not yours! Blindness and faith cannot meet. It is when you lose faith, you become blind.

NEWS FLASH The Swamis (Saints) from Adichunchungiri Mutt, arrived in our German Ashram. There was a grand Satsang on Friday night and a picnic to the nearby water fall on Sunday. Next stop - Mumbai.

More than four thousand people filled up a beautiful hall for a fabulous Satsang and a fantastic meditation led by Sri Sri.

The Five Insights

Love is your nature.

In the process of its expression, you often get caught up in the object. This is when your sight is caught outside. To return back to your nature, you need insight.

Pain is the first insight.

It takes you away from the object and turns you towards your body and mind.

Energy is the second insight.

A bolt of energy brings you back to your Self.

Divine Love is the third insight.

A glimpse of Divine love makes you so complete and over rules all the relative pleasures.

Trance is the fourth insight.

An elevation of consciousness and partial awareness of the physical reality around is Trance.

Non-dual existence, that all is made up of one and only one, is the fifth insight.

When love glows, it is bliss,

When it flows, it is compassion,

When it blows, it is anger,

When it ferments, it is jealously,

When it is all Nos, it is hatred,

When it acts, it is perfection,

When love Knows, it is ME!

5. All talents manifest

To the degree you feel connected to the Guru, these qualities manifest in your life.

Yagnas are the ancient method of enriching the subtle. They also purify the individual and the collective consciousness.

Yagna has three aspects:

1. Deva Puja: Acknowledging and honoring the Divine in all the forms.

2. Sangatikarana: Hastening the process of evolution by bringing together all the elements and people in creation.

3. Dana: Sharing and giving what one has been blessed with.

The depth of Sri Sri's silence was such a contrast to the noisy, irritant celebration. Activities start early in the morning and finish late at night. The Meditation Hall has become a feast for the senses. The Ashram is fully lit and so are the faces. The vedic chanting, the beat of the drums, the loud clarinets, the visiting Swamis and the usual ecstatic bhajans have made it magical.

New clothes and gifts were distributed to the poorest of the poor women from seven villages. For many of them it was the very first gift of new garments in their life and there was such gratitude. The rich fasted and prayed and the poor feasted in this genuine celebration.

God As A Child

Can you see God as a child? You have always thought of God as a father, up in the heavens somewhere. Can you see God as a child?

God is the very core of your existence. You are pregnant with God. You have to take care of your pregnancy and deliver the child into the world. Most people do not even deliver. One who delivers can also grant wishes.

God is your child. He/She clings onto to you like a baby till you grow old and die. God keeps crying for nourishment. God clings onto the devotee. He/She needs you to nourish Him/Her in the world. Sadhana, Satsang and Seva are the nourishment.

You always think of God as a father. Then you want to demand and take from God. But when you see God as a child, you have no demands.

Belma says: You cannot pray to a child; you can only pray to your father.

Sri Sri: Why do you want to pray? Why do you want to ask? A good father knows what to give.

Belma: What about surrender?

Sri Sri: Your surrender to a child is more authentic as it has no demand.

TAKE CARE OF YOUR GOD! Atheists are around the corner! Doubts, disbelief and ignorance are atheists in your mind, so better take care of your God!

FEEL BLESSED

Break through all the barriers and feel that you Are Blessed. This Is The One And Only Step You Have To take - the rest will all happen.

This deep sense of feeling that "I am blessed" can help you overcome any obstacles in life. It gives you courage and confidence and it will open your lid for grace to be poured in.

Once you realize that you are blessed, then:

All the complaints disappear

All the grumbling disappears

All the insecurities disappear

A sense of feeling unloved disappears

Wanting love disappears.

If you don't realize you are blessed, then the doership begins. If you want to make a difference in your life, feel you are blessed. And especially for those on this path of knowledge, there is no reason for you to not feel blessed.

So, feel you are blessed.

This is the first step towards the Self.

DIWALI

Time and space are infinite. Grains of sand are countless. Atoms in the universe are innumerable. So also the stars, the galaxies. The same is with the life on this planet. Neither is there a beginning nor is there an end, because it is all spherical. A sphere has neither a beginning nor an end, nor a goal, nor a direction. Truth has no direction, no goal. Truth itself is the goal and truth is infinite.

Feeling or experiencing the infinity within this finite body, living the timelessness within the time span of life, uncovering the bliss within the misery. This is what you are here for.

Today is Diwali - the Festival of Lights. The streets and buildings are lit up with colorful lights. The four aspects of Diwali:

1. The lights: Symbolic of spreading the Knowledge.

2. Fire crackers: When the explosion happens outside, the explosion inside is diffused.

3. Gift exchange and distribution of sweets: Sweets dispel the bitterness and renew the friendship.

4. Feeling abundance: Brings awareness and gratefulness for what one has.

When true wisdom dawns, it gives rise to celebration, and in celebration you may lose focus or awareness. The ancient rishis knew this so to maintain awareness in the midst of gaiety of celebration, they brought sacredness and puja to every celebration.

Celebrate the Knowledge and feel the abundance, for "those who have will be given more"!

NEWS FLASH After the trip to Shimoga, the Ashram hosted a Family Day for local course graduates while their guests were introduced to the Knowledge and programs. A Maha Kriya was held for 2,000. Lunch served to 4,000 without a hitch was a marvel to behold, and volunteers were jumping and dancing by the end of the day.

After Satsang in Pune, crowds crushed onto the stage for Darshan with Guruji, while volunteers were busy controlling the ever-enthusiastic crowd. The thousands of pairs of neatly packaged and numbered shoes in the entry way got into disarray in the chaos which followed. Many people lost their shoes but they were too happy to care.

The next morning, in spite of it's being a peak-season Diwali business day, 1,800 course graduates joined Guruji for Satsang.

Coincidentally, on this day of Diwali festival, 60 blind women are beginning a week-long residential course at the Bangalore Ashram.

3. Shrink or shy away.

4. Feel foolish and awkward.

5. Try to reciprocate even though it is not genuine.

YOUR EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE

You feel a lot of love for someone and they do not take it. What do you do?

1. Get frustrated

2. Turn the love into hatred and wish for revenge

3. Again and again remind them how much you love them and how little they love you

4. Become fussy and cranky

5. Throw tantrums

6. Feel humiliated and try to protect your respect

7. Resolve never to love again

8. Feel hurt and mistreated

9. Try to be aloof and indifferent

...and you have seen that none of these work. They only make the situation worse. What is the way out of this? How do you maintain your lovingness?

1.Have patience and change your expression of love.

2. Be centered and limit your expression of love. Sometimes over-expression of love puts people off.

3. Take it for granted that they love you too and accept their style of expression. For example, a mother with three kids. One child talks, one child does not talk, one child throws tantrums. Mother's love is the same irrespective of their behavior.

4. Genuinely acknowledge their love for you. This will turn your demand into gratefulness and the more you are grateful in life, the more love comes your way.

5. Know that hurt is part of love and take responsibility for it. When you move away from your center, you will definitely get hurt and the nature of worldliness is misery.

EGO

When is there Ego?

1. When you don't get attention.

2. When you seem to be losing attention.

3. When you get attention (Laughter).

Ego causes heaviness, discomfort. It doesn't let love flow. Ego can be transcended by knowing the Truth; by enquiring "Who am I?" Often, your attitude towards one who has ego is of contempt or jealousy. But rather you should have compassion, or even pity, isn't it?

There is also a positive aspect of ego. It drives one to do some work. A person will do a job either out of compassion or out of ego. Most of the work in the society is by boosting the ego. But in Satsang, work is done out of love. Ego is separateness; non-belongingness. It is wanting to prove and to possess.

And when you wake up and see, there is nothing to be proved and nothing to possess, ego dissolves.

The Satsang tour continued on to Hyderabad, where despite a cyclone warning, swarms of people came to be blessed by the Master and were surprised to hear Him speaking chaste Telugu.

MEMORY

It is memory that makes you miserable or wise. Memory of events and experiences of the changing finite binds you, and memory of your nature liberates you. Memory of the ever changing relative, however good or bad, brings bondage. Memory of the non-changing self elevates awareness. Memory of past events and worldly concerns constricts the vastness of the self. It is all a matter of where you are, of what you are. If you are ignorant, it is because of your memory. If you are enlightened, it is because of your memory.

Forgetfulness of the trivial is ecstasy.

Forgetfulness of the infinite is misery.

Q. How does one get rid of unpleasant memories and limitations?

1. Know the impermanent nature of the world and events.

2. Know the non-existence of past events right now and accept them.

3. Be dispassionate and centered. Memories of Self are gained by service to the noble.

4. Increase prana - So Ham! So what!!

5. Have Divine company / presence.

Q: Are emotion and intellect contradictory?

Ans: They can be contradictory.

Q: When there is a conflict, which is better?

Ans: There is no better conflict, in conflict. The pure intellect rises beyond conflicts. The pure intellect is not caught up in the emotional turbulence of the mind. Otherwise the intellect often gets coloured by the emotion and becomes impure like muddy water. Then it is unable to reflect the Self. Whereas pure intellect, still and serene, reflects the Self.

Q: Is intellect affected by Karma?

Ans: Karma does not afflict the pure intellect. Liberation is purifying the intellect. The Sanskrit word for intellect is Buddhi and one who is liberated is Buddha.

NEWS FLASH

Sri Avtar Hari, a well known Saint from Haridwar, blessed the Ashram and was with Guruji for three days. The Russians, Polish, Chinese and other international groups, left for God's own country - Kerala, with Guruji! The first stop at the state capital Thiruvananthapuram saw a gathering of six thousand people. From there the entourage rode to Cochin. At Cochin, the open ground by the seaside was fabulously decorated. Caparisoned elephants in traditional style and little angels with flowers and lamps accorded a warm welcome. The big ground was packed with around ten thousand people. Imagine how much time it took for the Darshan line! Then on to the cultural capital of Kerala - Thrissur where again over five thousand people gathered for a grand satsang in an indoor stadium. The teamwork at Thrissur was a unique example and this time around, the volunteers felt no pressure; they did very little but a lot happened. The entourage proceeded to Calicut. Not a space even for an ant to crawl at the biggest auditorium in Calicut and many had to be content watching the satsang in the closed circuit television placed outside.

The volunteers did a marvelous job throughout Kerala. Many healing experiences were reported during Satsangs. Guruji is back in the Bangalore Ashram for an other fortnight.

Time And Mind

When the mind contracts, when it is unhappy, time appears to be too long. When the mind expands, when it is happy, time appears to be too short. When the mind is in equanimity, it transcends time.

When the mind is dull or unconscious, it is unable to experience itself. When the mind is excited or happy, time seems to be too short and when the mind is miserable, time seems to be too long. To escape from the two extremes, many resort to alcohol, sleep etc.....

Samadhi, no-mindedness or timelessness, is peace, the Real peace. That is the greatest healer. Time is the greatest healer.

Just like the mind experiences time, this moment has a mind of its own, a Big Mind which has enormous and infinite organizing power. Thought is nothing but a ripple in this moment, and thus a few moments of Samadhi gives the mind a lot of energy.

Before you fall into slumber or as soon as you wake up from sleep, in the moments of twilight of Consciousness, experience the timelessness!!

NEWS FLASH:

- In Apple Valley, California, 80 homeless children were given gifts at a Christmas party specially organized for them.

- In slums in Mumbai, Satsangs and Seva projects have begun.

- A Blood Donation Camp was organized in Surat.

- People of some of the villages around the Ashram were given free housing.

At a Satsang, somebody suggested that we have some deer, peacocks, swans and doves at the Ashram. Sri Sri promptly answered "You are all dear to me! You are peacocks because you dance! Like swans you have Vivek - the power of discrimination and just as doves do you carry the message of peace from here to the World!!!"

Faces Of Infinity

You have many faces. Only you don't face them. When you come face to face with your faces then conflicts, confusion and chaos arise in you.

From time to time in different phases, different faces appear. As you come close to your Being, all the faces melt and leave you as the Space that you are.

At the gross level, you identify yourself as somebody. At a subtle level, you identify yourself as some energy or an incarnation of some angel, saint or prophet.

When you go beyond even this identity, you are whole, holy, Brahman - Purna Brahman Narayana.

NEWS FLASH: The Ashram bid farewell to the Russians.... but Southeast Asians, Southern Africans, Malaysians and a LOT of Indians from all directions have occupied every available space.

Amidst the hectic activity in the Ashram, there is deep silence and serenity. The Advanced Course, TTC, Sahaj Samadhi Course, Basic Course and ART Excel are in full swing.

Celebration

Celebration Is Pure Vibration

Human life is a combination of matter, i.e., body and spirit or vibration. Isn't it? Pleasure or joy is becoming intense vibration. Joy is forgetting that you are matter and so you become intense vibration. All the carnal instincts will also make you feel intense vibrations momentarily. And that's how they give a glimpse of joy. But the thing is, it is short lived and it makes you dense later on. Pleasure that comes from Satsang is of a higher nature. Mantra and singing create vibrations in the spirit. That's why when you sing, the ecstasy stays for a long time. Pleasure in the subtle is long lasting, energizing, refreshing and freeing. Pleasure from the gross is short lived, tiring and binding.

When you know you are electricity (vibration/energy), then craving, greed, lust and anger disappear. And you become true celebration.

Message for Christmas: You are the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree is pointing upwards and its branches grow on all sides. It is orderly. At the time of year when no tree bears anything, it has many gifts to offer. And it is green throughout the year. A Christmas tree bears the gifts and the lights not for itself. All the gifts you are carrying in your life are for others. Anyone who comes to you, you offer them your gifts.

There were lots of gifts around Sri Sri's couch. John asked Sri Sri, "Are you going to open the gifts?" Sri Sri winked and pointed at the people and said, "I am always opening the gifts." (Laughter)

Your life is a gift. And you have come to unwrap the gift. In the process of unwrapping, you also save the wrappers. Your whole environment, situations, circumstances and body are the wrapping papers. When we unwrap, we destroy the wrapping paper. We are in such a hurry at times that we even destroy the gifts. With patience and endurance, open your gifts and save the wrapping papers.

NEWS FLASH: As hectic activities continue in the Bangalore Ashram, Sri Sri moved on to Madras for a huge Satsang. Then He went to Delhi where He met the Vice President of India. An unscheduled Satsang where around 12 hundred devotees gathered just by word of mouth! The same night Sri Sri left for Germany. The entire German Ashram is decorated. Every corridor and corner wears a festive look. Smiles from the people of 18 countries are the moving decorations.

There were lots of gift boxes of various sizes nicely wrapped up. And as Sri Sri kept lifting them, many of them were found to be hollow and empty!

Thanks to the whole seva team who has transformed the Ashram into a warm and cozy home.

A Wise Man Is Happy Even In Bad Times

And The Stupid One Is Unhappy Even In Good Times

People who are willing to serve will have good times even in the bad times. when there are problems such as famine or war-torn countries, the Red Cross people will be fine as they are serving. The more relief they bring, the happier they feel. And people who are selfish and who just want to enjoy themselves will be miserable even in good times. Often the organizers of a party do not enjoy the party because some little thing is missing, they forgot to invite somebody, somebody did not come or some little thing went wrong.

A wise one is happy even in bad times. And the stupid one is unhappy even in good times.

You make the time good or bad. People usually blame the bad time and wait for the good time. Even if an astrologer says that you have a hopeless time, you can make it a good time!

Like weather, time has its own impact on you. But your Satsangs and sadhana are your shield, your protection! So realize that you are more than time and that you can move the time by your connection to the Divine.

Don't feel shy to speak about human and spiritual values. Time has come now to call the whole world!

THE ALL is calling,

The ball is rolling!

Time is milling,

The Soul is willing...

Riddle : The next year is three times the same and yet only one. What is it? Figure that out.

BE EVER NEW, HAPPY YOU !!!!

You Are Pure Electricity

Desires for sense pleasure are electric in nature and they get neutralized as they move towards the objects of senses. If, by your skill, you could move them within you towards the centre of your existence, another dimension of everlasting pleasure, thrill, bliss, and undying love will all be yours. Lust, greed, power and jealousy are also powerful because they are nothing but energy and you are the source of it - the pure electricity. Dedication and devotion keep the purity of your electricity and they move you upward.

Realizing you are pleasure or electricity yourself your craving subsides and serenity dawns. Remembering that you will die makes you alive now, free from cravings and aversions. The wise is always careful not to get entangled and dizzy in the mind.

NEWS FLASH

Politics

Don't let politics sway you away from the path. If you are afraid of politics you cannot be successful in the spiritual realm. You have to cross the barricade of politics. It is the test of your strength, commitment, and your focus. You cannot avoid politics, but to harbor it in your mind or not, is your choice. There were politics among the 12 apostles, and with Buddha. And Krishna was in politics from head to toe. And you say you don't want politics? The more you don't want it, the more you will harbor it in your consciousness. When you recognize politics in any group or Satsang, that is a blessing for you to be centered and go inward. You can do that without blaming the group and running away from people, or chickening out. It can enhance your skill to act and not get attached.

Advantages of politics:

-- Brings up diversity in people.

-- Puts in front of you different viewpoints, ways, and tendencies.

-- Enhances your skill to communicate and act.

-- Brings centeredness and dispassion.

-- Shakes you up and makes you stand up to the knowledge.

-- Enhances your capacity to accept and tolerate.

-- Makes you realize the whole life is a game.

Cross the threshold of politics and come to the Divine.

The strong will smile through the politics and the weak will lament.

Neither Accept People As They Are

Not Tolerate Them

Many people think tolerance is a virtue.

Tolerance is a negative term. If you like something you don't have to tolerate. Tolerance indicates a deep sense of dislike, which can at any time turn into hatred. It indicates a sense of separateness . . small mindedness . . limitation of consciousness.

When you are tolerating, it is a temporary state. Tolerance is a potential volcano. If you are tolerating it means you are holding on.

Acceptance is also negative. You accept that which is not lovable.

Question: Don't you need a sense of self-assurance to then go and love people?

This is our company. The Self-Assurance Company. It is only the Self that is always assuring. Nothing else.

Tolerance and acceptance come with judgment and separation. These words which are used, tolerance and acceptance are thought to be positive. I say they are not.

Question: But aren't we supposed to accept people as they are?

If you don't love them, then you have to accept them.

DON'T ACCEPT PEOPLE AS THEY ARE. JUST LOVE THEM AS THEY ARE.

NEWS FLASH: From Surinam the entourage moved on to Bogota, the capital of Columbia where Guruji was interviewed for national television. After the interview, the lady said she has to change her whole series which was entitled "Tolerance." Organizers were bewildered as they were unprepared for such a huge crowds at the evening talk. Then Guruji moved on to Panama where a minute-by-minute program was put together by Martine and her team. The celebration moved on to Costa Rica for a day where, in contrast, the hall had enough space for three seats for each person. Satsangs were just a dozen devotees and Guruji fed them all. Then on to Florida where Guruji commented from the beautiful space on the 28th floor, "I am staying in the second best place, the first being my Self!" Then Ronnie Newman had organized a talk sponsored by the Crime Prevention Unit of Nova Southeastern University. It was attended by scientist, researchers, therapists, and justice personnel. It was fabulous!

False Security

False securities do not allow your faith to grow. When you have dropped your securities, then your faith grows. When you buffer your life with securities, you keep the faith away. It is the faith that brings perfection in you. Faith is the greatest security.

If you have all the material securities and not have faith, you will still reel in fear. You have to let go of all possessions in the mind. False security is keeping things where they don't belong. It is an illusion of security because of having a job, a house, friends. Keep the house where it belongs, not in the mind. Keep the money in the bank or in the pocket, not in the mind. Keep friends and family where they belong, not in the mind.

The Divine is your only security.

Faith is realizing that you always get what you need.

Faith is giving the Divine a chance to act.

Your body belongs to the world. Your spirit belongs to the Divine.

NEWS FLASH:

Riding in the car back to Verna's house after satsang, Kumi said, "Lets take the long way home!"

Gurudev said, "I am making the ride home short, but you want to go for a long ride!"

Sri Sri gave a brilliant talk to over 200 people on the World's Great Religions and Their Transformation in the 21st Century at the most prestigious University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). A number of students started the Basic course that evening. The Santa Monica Advanced Course Satsangs were filled with laughter, brilliant questions and even more brilliant answers. Divya's voice lifted everyone's hearts. One evening Scott invited over 80 people to come for the first time and hear Sri Sri speak. Sri Sri did not say a word. He gave the entire talk in his own version of sign language. It was hilarious. The deaf people present were in tears because of the brilliance Sri Sri showed in his conceptual understanding of sign language.

David said, "Punditji, you travel and work so much - 20 countries in one month - do you ever take a vacation?"

Devotion And Organization

Organization is control. Devotion is chaos!

Organization needs attention to details, a material awareness. Organization is being worldly.

Devotion is getting lost, forgetting the world, being in ecstasy.

These are opposite in nature. They don't go together, yet they cannot be apart or exist without each other. No organization can arise without devotion. When there is so much devotion, you simply want to organize. Devotion brings faith, compassion, and responsibility. With responsibility and caring, you want to give knowledge, wisdom, and love. Then organization happens. So organization exists through devotion.

If you are devoted, you won't just sit. The nature of devotion is to give. If you think you are devoted and you are not caring for the world, then you are merely selfish. Real devotion means being one with the Divine, and the Divine cares for the world.

Often you lose devotion in organizing. And often in the name of devotion you create chaos and disregard the organization. You have to be a saint to be both in organization and devotion. If you have both, you are on the mark. So . . .

Get lost and be guided!

NEWS FLASH: Sri Sir received a royal Hawaiian welcome from many new devotees when he arrived on the island of Oahu. John Osborne spoke on a local TV health show, and the largest Healing Breath Workshop ever on Oahu was taught in Guruji's presence.

When A Mistake Is Not A Mistake

Blessed are those who don't see a mistake as a mistake....!!!

But it is hard not to see your own mistake. Outwardly you may justify yourself or prove your innocence to someone else, but a mistake pricks a conscience. Do not justify yourself. Instead, feel the prick of the mistake. That very pinch will take you out of the mistake.

A mistake means something that brings misery to you in the long run. So why would someone knowingly commit a mistake?

While pointing out a mistake to someone, do you consider him as separate from you and go on pointing out his error or do you make him feel a part of you? When you point out a mistake to someone, does it make him more stressed, or does it create more awareness in that person? Often you do not point out someone's mistake when it is required. Not pointing out a mistake -- with due consideration to time and place -- is also a mistake.

When you make a new mistake, it is not a mistake; you have learned a valuable lesson. But when you keep doing the same mistake over and over, it is a BIG mistake. A mistake simply means you have missed taking a lesson that has come your way.

Do not lament over your mistake. Just take the lesson from it. You will not be judged by your mistakes, but by your virtues. Mistakes are of the earth. Virtues are of the Divine.

Wise is the one who learns from other's mistakes.

Less wise is the one who learns from his own mistakes.

The fool keeps making the same mistakes again and again and never learns from them.

NEWS FLASH: In Bali, we went to the ancient temple of Besaki. Here, as in the old days, there is only the empty seat of the Deity, which signifies the divine beyond form. The Indonesian Director of Religious Affairs and a member of the Ministry of Education welcomed Sri Sri at the opening of our Jakarta Ashram. In an inaugural speech, they said they believed Sri Sri's visit would influence the economic crisis in Indonesia. The very next day, the Indonesian currency (Rupiah) was 30% stronger. The devotees from Jakarta have adopted an orphanage in Puncak, which they visit regularly. The director of the orphanage said that while other people bring money, clothes and toys, our group had supplied the missing nutrient the children needed the most : love! The children each received a package of school supplies and goodies. We all laughed, sang and danced as the director cried tears of gratitude. The entourage moved to Singapore where more than 1,000 people welcomed Sri Sri at the packed SLF Auditorium. The evening commenced with a traditional Chinese lion dance; later Sri Sri gave practical points on "Awakening the Beauty Within You."

Respect

When someone respects you, it is not because you possess some virtues, it is because of their generosity, their greatness. If you say God is great, it makes YOU great. God is anyway already great, you saying so doesn't affect God.

When you respect someone, it only shows your own magnanimity. How many people you don't respect in the world, that much less is your wealth. If you respect everyone in the world, that much more is your value. Wiser is the one who respects everyone.

Question : But Gurudev, you can't respect a terrorist!

Sri Sri : You have to respect a terrorist too because he shows you the way at his own cost.

Respectfulness is a quality of refined consciousness. Respect for the Self is faith. Faith is being open.

If you are open, you are close.

If you are close, you cannot but open up.

Bhanu greeted the entourage with smiles and roses as we arrived in India at 1:30 am. Touring through all the Ashram facilities, Guruji personally saw to each ones comfort and accommodations until well past dawn.

Mahashivaratri

The whole world functions according to laws of Nature. What is that? That is Shiva.

The whole world is moving in an auspicious rhythm of innocence and intelligence. That auspiciousness is divinity. Shiva is harmonious innocence which knows no control.

Shiva reversed is Vashi. Vashi means control. Control is of the mind. Control means two, weakness. One is not doing something naturally but exerting pressure. Often people think they are in control of their lives, their situation. Control is an illusion. Control is a temporary exertion of energy in the mind. That is Vashi.

Shiva is opposite. Shiva is the permanent and eternal source of Energy, the eternal state of Being, the One without a second.

Duality is the cause of fear. That harmonious innocence dissolves duality.

When the moment is whole, complete, then that moment is Divine. In the moment means no regret of the past, no want for the future. Time stops, the mind stops.

NEWS FLASH The Conference of the International Association for Human Values continues. The Ayurvedic Clinic is dispensing knowledge and remedies day and night. Live performances of traditional Vedic arts including a sitar recital, an evening of mohiniattam dance, and bamboo flute, each held under Sumeru's starry canopy, delighted all. Delegates traveled to Mysore where they visited the famed Palace, the Shiva Temple, and Brindavana Gardens. Warming up for Shivaratri, delegates and visitors from throughout the world were treated to a Festival of Foods, with delicacies from many states of India. Today, the Celebration dawned early with the silent power of Shiva Puja and is continuing into tomorrow's early morning with singing, ecstatic dancing and waves of unbounded enthusiasm.

Formality Is Foreign To Self

Cordiality Is One's Nature

You cannot eliminate formality in society. It has to be given its place. But devoid of cordiality, formality can be hypocritical. Cordiality alone may cause chaos and may even appear sometimes to be uncaring.

Formality improves communication; cordiality improves communion - oneness. Communication is only necessary where there are two. Formality maintains duality.

Structures are based on formality. Love and knowledge are based on cordiality. For love and knowledge to blossom, you need an informal, cordial environment.

An organization cannot happen, orderliness cannot prevail, if the formalities are abandoned.

All actions are measured steps of formality. Devotion is informal and totally chaotic.

Cordiality is the core of one's existence, formality is the outer shell. When the outer shell is thin, it can reflect the inner light. Like the dome of the lamp softens the light. But if the dome is too opaque, you cannot see the light. So, we need to strike a balance between cordial formality and formal cordiality.

NEWS FLASH: The delegates from the International Conference on Human Values flew en-masse to Ahmedabad where they experienced an enormous wave of Gujarati hospitality at a musical dancing reception at the airport followed by dinner and a riotous Satsang in a traditional Indian village setting. The next morning, the delegates joined in a Maha Kriya of more than 3000 devotees personally led by Sri Sri, then toured Mahatma Gandhi's Ashram and ended an unforgettable day with a Maha Satsang of over 20,000 (Darshan alone took 4 hours!). The delegates then traveled north to Rishikesh nestled between the Himalayas and the head waters of the Ganges. Sri Sri led a bath in the river at sunset as devotees launched floating ghee lamps from the river banks to honor the auspicious occasion. The Conference continues in silence with visiting Saints, profoundly deep meditation and new levels of knowledge and experience.

You Are The Tenth

Ten people were going from one village to another. On the way they had to cross a river. After crossing they wanted to be sure all were there. Each one started counting but counted only nine. They were very distraught and began to cry for the loss of the tenth.

A wise man came along and asked them "Oh my dear friends, why are you crying?"

"We were ten but now we are only nine," they replied.

The wise man saw they were ten, so he asked them to count. Each counted nine but left out himself. Then the wise man made them stand and count, and he said to the last person, "You are the tenth!"

And they all rejoiced for having regained the tenth.

Similarly the five senses and the four inner faculties (mind, intellect, memory, ego) all lament when they lose sight of the Self. Then the Master comes and shows you that You are the tenth! Count, but never stop until you find the tenth. The joy is in finding the Ever Present.

With the knowledge of the Self inside everything is truly joyful.

Q: What did Brahma think when he made this creation?

Sri Sri: He didn't think before doing. He didn't take anyone's suggestion -- I would have given him a few.

NEWS FLASH: Bhajans were coming out from a locked suitcase! Do you think it was a miracle? No, it was a hoax. While being transported, a tape recorder inside was turned on by impact and brought great delight to the volunteers who worked into the early morning to prepare for the departure of the International Advanced Course participants.

Inside Out

Often people say, "Be the same inside as out". I ask you, how is this possible?

Inside you are a vast ocean, infinite sky; what you can show outside is only a tiny bit of it. Outside you are finite, just a small limited form, a normal stupid person!

All that you are, the love, the beauty, the compassion, the Divinity, doesn't show up fully. What shows up is the crust of behaviors. Ask yourself, "Are you really your behaviors? Are you just your behavioral patterns"? No....... Don't mistake this crust for your inside.

Neither take the limited body/mind complex as your inside nor show your Infinite Lordship outside, for Divinity is not easily understood. Let there be some mystery.

DON'T BE THE SAME INSIDE AND OUT!!

NEWS FLASH: For Holi, the Festival of Colors, the saints, merchant community and prominent people of Rishikesh joined with our course participants to celebrate. Sri Sri said The heart is white, the sign of purity in life; the head is orange, the symbol of sacrifice and life is all colorful. Later in the week Sri Sri met with the Shankaracharya and other saints. The school in Bangalore Ashram celebrated its Annual School Day with many local dignitaries along with parents in attendance.

Many healings were reported this week including a 56-year old man who had lost his vision, reporting after Kriya that he can now read the newspaper; a man who had suffered from abnormal blood pressure for 10-12 years was found to have normal blood pressure after learning Sudarshan Kriya. A 65 year old woman who has not even taken the course, the mother-in-law of a devotee, had a brain hemorrhage and multiple injuries caused by a fall. She was hospitalized on the 10th of January and remained there showing no improvement until the 2nd of March. She was unable to recognize even her own son. On the 2nd of March the doctors said nothing more could be done and gave her six hours to live. A photo of Sri Sri was placed on her bed. Her daughter-in-law held her hand and prayed. The next day, to the amazement of all, most especially the doctors, the blood sugar report, the EEG, the ECG, and all other reports were completely normal and she could recognize everyone. She is now home and managing the house while her daughter-in-law completes TTC.

Dreams

When something is unbelievably beautiful or joyful, you wonder whether it is a dream. Often, what you perceive as reality is not joyful and so when misery is there, you never wonder if it is a dream. You are sure it is real. This is knowing the real as unreal and unreal as real. In fact, all the miseries are unreal. A wise man knows that happiness is real, as it is one's very nature. Unhappiness is unreal as it is inflicted by memory. When you see everything as a dream, then you abide in your true nature.

Payal asks : "What about a nightmare?"

Sri Sri : A nightmare is a dream mistaken as reality. There is no confusion in a dream at all. Keep wondering whether all this is a dream and you'll wake up to the real.

Impression And Expression

Do not make an effort to impress others, or to express yourself. Your effort to express yourself becomes an impediment. Your effort to impress someone also becomes futile. If you do not try to impress, expression comes naturally. When you come from the self, your expression is perfect and your impression lasts for ages.

Often you don't seem to have a control over your impressions and expressions. Wisdom is selecting your impressions and expressions. Enlightenment is when you do not take any impressions at all, whether good or bad. Then you "master" the art of expression. Many impressions in the mind cause:

- Confusion

- Distraction

- Chaos

- Lack of focus

- and finally, derangement of the mind.

Nature has inbuilt in us a system through which it releases some of the impressions - through dreams, and through meditation.

Excessive expression loses the depth and luster, the serenity of yourself. Meditation erases the impressions and improves the expression.

Those who traveled with Sri Sri marveled at his stamina and unconditional love.

Then on to Calcutta - the City of Joy - where Sri Sri was seen smiling from nook and corner - huge hoardings, TV screens even movie theaters. The stage is set for two grand Satsangs, where thousands are eagerly awaiting the Master.

Tarka, Vitarka And Kutarka

To know yourself or to judge your actions you need to know Tarka, Vitarka and Kutarka.

Kutarka is wrong logic. Most people apply this logic and get caught up in ignorance. For example : The door is half open means the door is half closed. Therefore, the door is fully open means the door is fully closed!

Or: God is Love. Love is Blind. Therefore, God is Blind!!!

Tarka is sequential logical understanding; it increases scientific knowledge. When sequential logical understanding changes, then scientific conclusions change. For example: Pesticides and antibiotics were considered to be very useful in the past, and are now proven to be more harmful. In tarka, the paradigm changes.

Vitarka is asking questions to which there are no evident answers....Who am I? Where am I? What do I really want? These philosophically appealing questions bring forth spiritual knowledge, increase your awareness and bring about the blossoming of Consciousness, i.e., Atma Gyan increases.

The wise know to distinguish between the three. They will not apply kutarka or tarka for vitarka, and vitarka for tarka.

NEWS FLASH: The Commissioner of Human Rights in Assam received Sri Sri in Guwahati. That evening there was a jubilant satsang. The devotees went on a picnic with Sri Sri to a hilltop on the banks of the Brahmaputra River.

The next day Sri Sri arrived in Calcutta where the Ganguly house was transformed into a dreamland with magical decorations. On the same day, he addressed the Calcutta Management Association. The following day, he enlightened an elite group of ambassadors, officials and politicians on Face to Face - a television program. 8000 people attended the Grand Satsang at Calcutta. Sri Sri spoke very little, but left everybody with a happy smile.

Sri Sri's black bag was lost and found miraculously after a week!!! Easter Advanced Courses are happening all over the world.

Softness And Forcefulness

Certain types of people are soft and their softness comes out of lack of courage and forcefulness. There is yet another type of softness in people and this softness comes out of maturity, magnanimity, and the knowledge of the Self.

The people who are soft out of lack of courage suffer a lot. And sometime or other they become volatile.

Similarly there are two types of forcefulness in people Ö aggression or assertiveness. Some people are forceful in an aggressive manner out of weakness, lack of strength, or out of fear. Others are forceful out of care and love, out of compassion.

David: Aggressive control and aggressive support.

Guruji: So look into yourself and become aware of what type of softness and what type of forcefulness you have.

NEWS FLASH: There were spring and cherry blossoms in the German ashram and as Guruji came, snow also came. Three new countries joined the Art of Living map this month: Bulgaria, Namibia, and the Dominican Republic

Decision And Confusion

Decision comes only when there is confusion. When there is no confusion then there is no decision. For example, if there is a piece of wood and a biscuit on your desk, you don't decide which one to eat, isn't that right? Decision is always about choice and choice is always confusing. So, all decision-makers are confused! (Laughter)

Action is spontaneous when there is no actor. In you, there is an actor and there is a witness. An actor is either confused or decisive, but the witness realizes that the action is spontaneous and smiles.

The more decisions you make, the more confused you are, and as a result you swing between pain and pleasure. The more the witness grows in you, the more playful and untouched you are. Trust, faith, love and joy all manifest in and around you.

Are you confused, decided or happy now?

Eberhard: Confusion is too strong of an expression. Is it not rather "choice"?

Urmila: We are decided that choice is confusion. (Everyone laughs)

Hans Peter: Is there any freedom without confusion?

Sri Sri: When you are confused, there is no freedom.

Hans Peter: What is freedom of choice?

Sri Sri: Confusion! (Laughter)

NEWS FLASH: There was a big discussion whether Guruji should wear a plain white or a white with gold shawl for the evening "Human Values Conference". Everyone was confused because there was a choice, but still there was a lot of laughter!

You Are Privileged

Among all planets in the solar system, the earth is privileged to host life in its many forms, and among all the species, humans are most privileged for they can host the Knowledge. Among all the knowledgeable ones, you are most privileged. .... guess why.

Again and again you remember that you are peace, you are love, you are joy and that you are hosting the Creator. If you donÒ´ realize that you are the host, you live like a ghost.

The under-privileged are those who do not realize that they are privileged, and so they also host, but they host all the negativities.

Like the birds returning to their nests, again and again come back to your source; only there can you realize that you host the Creator.

NEWS FLASH: A delighted crowd greeted Sri Sri Ravi Shankar with a loud applause after the debate and a short meditation in the Inter-Faith Conference on Human Values which was held in the prestigious Hamburg University Auditorium.

The Indian Ambassador in Vienna hosted a Satsang in his home. They took good care of our group and we enjoyed the Indian hospitality in Austria too.

Yet another brilliant exposition of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and his ideas was the delight for nearly one hundred and fifty diplomats and U.N. officials in the meeting organized by Mary and her team in Vienna.

Guruji visited Rome on 6 May after 11 years of absence.

The Value of Chanting

Your whole body is made up of atoms.

Being with this truth kindles the energy in you and brings up the consciousness. When you sing bhajans, the Sound Energy Vibration Gets Absorbed Into Every Particle Of Your Body.

Just like a microphone absorbs sound and converts it into electricity, the body absorbs the vibrations and converts it into consciousness.

When you sit in bhajans your entire body gets soaked in energy and transformation happens. If your are sitting and listening to gossip or violent music, then that gets absorbed by your body and does not give a nice feeling.

When you hear the Knowledge, or chant with all your heart, that elevates your consciousness.

There is an ancient proverb in Sanskrit which says that the words of rishis and enlightened ones are translated into experience immediately.

Bawa says: We have read and heard from so many people, but when Guruji speaks the same knowledge it straight-away hits home.

NEWS FLASH: A family of devotees has a cat which only ate dried fish. Within a few weeks of doing Sudarshan Kriya, they found that their cat, too, has turned vegetarian and will not even look at fish any more!

One of our teachers had an operation after which it was discovered that an absent-minded doctor left a metal clip inside her abdomen. On later examination it was found that in addition to the clip, a large stone developed in the gall bladder and had caused an internal abscess. She was to have surgery on the same day that she had wanted to go to the Bangalore Ashram. That day, when they checked again, the doctors were surprised that there was no clip, no stone and no abscess!

PS: Guruji was not born, but 2000 people came to the ashram to celebrate his birthday. Prashanth and his housing team were applauded for the way they avoided chaos.

Ishani and Bawa's dogs also turned vegetarian.

INTENSIFY YOUR LONGING

Attainment Of The Divine Depends On The Intensity Of Longing And Not On The Time And Qualification.

There is a proverb among the villagers in India, which says that it may take some time to pluck a flower but it takes no time to meet the Divine ! Abilities, qualifications are not the criteria. It is simply the intensity of your longing.

Intensify your longing for the Divine right away. This you can do when you know that you want nothing and you are nothing.

Suneeta: If we are nothing and we want nothing, how can longing come?

Sidappa: Knowing you are nothing and you want nothing brings belongingness:

....and belongingness intensifies longing.

Bill: What is the difference between desire and longing?

Sri Sri: Desire is the fever of the head. Longing is the cry of the heart.

NEWS FLASH!

The Ashram is buzzing with activity. One Advanced Course ended and another began, along with the Indian Teachers Meet. Teacher Training Phase 1 and Phase ll and Art Excel too! Ashram housing has overflowed into neighbouring resorts and hostels. Everyone felt the dire need for a bigger meditation hall and dining hall-huge tents were pitched for meditation.

Even as this shortage was felt, Sri Sri came up with yet another project -Health, Hygiene, Home and Higher states of consciousness- the 4 H's. In less than an hour, inspired devotees took up seva projects to provide drinking water, toilets, prayer halls and over 600 houses for the homeless in the rural districts all over India.

Vikram: Someone should take up a similar project for the Ashram.

Faith Is Your Wealth

Faith is a wealth. If you think, by having faith in God you are doing a favour to God, you are mistaken. Faith gives you strength instantaneously. Faith brings you stability, centeredness, calmness and love. You having Faith In The Guru Or God, Does Not Do Anything To Guru Or God. Your Having Faith Gives You Immediate Strength. Faith is a great wealth; it is a blessing.

If you lack faith, you have to pray for faith. But to pray, you need faith. This is a paradox. (Laughter)

People have faith in the world - but the whole world is just a soap bubble. People have faith in themselves - but they don't know who they are. People think that they have faith in God - but they have no idea of God. If you want to doubt, you have to doubt everything

There are three types of faith : faith in yourself, faith in the world, and faith in God. You need to have faith in yourself -- without faith, you think, I can't do this. This is not for me. I will never be liberated in this life. You must have faith in the world. Without this, you cant move an inch in the world. Banks give you loans having faith that you will pay it back. You deposit money in the bank having faith that it will be returned. If you doubt everything in the world, nothing will happen. The same is the case with faith in the Divine - have faith in the Divine and you will evolve. All these faiths are connected. You must have all three for each to be strong.

Bill : Atheists have faith in themselves and faith in the world, but not in God.

Sri Sri : They don't have complete faith in themselves. Lack of faith in God, in the world or in the self brings fear. Faith in the world cannot be constant because there are always changes.

Faith makes you full - faithful. If you have faith, you are full.

Rajesh : What is the difference between faith and confidence ?

Sri Sri : Confidence is the result. Faith is the beginning.

Faith in yourself brings freedom.

Faith in the world brings you peace of mind.

Faith in God evokes love in you.

You can be at peace by having faith in the world and without faith in God, but it is not complete peace. If you have love, there is automatically peace and freedom. People who are extremely disturbed should only have faith in God.

Colourful NEWS SPLASH! At the close of the Tamil Advanced Course, a satsang was held in the late afternoon in the Sumeru Mandap. After several bhajans, Guruji started chanting. Suddenly people started pointing into the western sky where a huge thundercloud appeared, the top of which was filled with brilliant colours of unusual intensity. The trees had been crying for water and within a few minutes, the wind started and it began to rain. What was it? It was not a rainbow. We contacted the weather observatory, but they had no idea of this phenomenon. When we asked the explanation for this, Guruji said, "Nature is our friend".

Miscellaneous Newsplashes - After hectic activities in Bangalore, Guruji tried to escape to Mangalore for 24 hours but it turned out to be another party. Art of Living representatives, headed by Sharada Lavingia were invited to the G -8 Summit reception in Birmingham, U.K. Art of Living was also represented in the World Health Organisation Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Teachers presented programmes in St. Petersburg, Russia. Women's prison programs have started in Bangalore. Reports of more seva projects are arriving from all over the world.

WHO WAKES UP FIRST?

Who Wakes Up First? You Or God?

You wake up first. God is still asleep. When you wake up first, you experience pain and pleasure. You become aware of the shortcomings of the world and its beauty. Then you cry for help and seek the ultimate and then you wake up God. And when God is awakened in you, there is no "two."

When both God and you are asleep, there is inertia. When the "I" is asleep, there is no experience.

God is in you in seed form. When he wakes up, you cease to exist. God is asleep in every particle in this universe. It's you who wakes up first and then you awaken God. And when God wakes up, neither you nor the world remain.

The rishis made a mockery. They created a practice of awakening God every morning. They call it Suprabhatam service. Many find this ridiculous because they don't understand the depth of it. Only awakened God can see that God is asleep everywhere. [Laughter.]

Brinda: Why should we wake up?

Sri Sri: Because you are not asleep. If you were asleep, how can you ask the question?

Bill: Once you are awake, can you go back to sleep?

Sri Sri: If you have not had tea, of course.

Bill: Who wakes us up?

Sri Sri: You figure that out.

NEWSFLASH! A tree planting program was begun at the Bangalore ashram. Guruji met with villagers and inaugurated the 4-H program: health, hygiene, home and human values. Satsang groups were started in the villages around the ashram. Guruji travelled from Bangalore to Bombay which was covered with big billboards. The city Satsang attracted over 5,000. When Guruji and entourage arrived at the airport for the trip to Mauritius, we were told the flight was overbooked and we would have to take a later flight. Guruji showed his "Guru card" and suddenly everything worked and all seven travellers had seats on the plane.

Then on to Mauritius where the volunteers did a wonderful job organising many events: interviews with television and radio, two Satsangs, a lecture at the University, audiences with the president and prime minister, and a visit to an old age home (attended by the Minister of Health and Minister of Women). The local Art of Living society has adopted the old age home as a seva project. During his last visit to Mauritius, Guruji captured the police, and this time he met with wardens and other prison officials. Vikram recorded the Seeds of Wisdom at a local radio station, which will broadcast one quote each day for the next month.

This ends the third year of Weekly Knowledge.

BEYOND THE RATIONAL MIND: BREAKING THE BARRIER

We Usually Do Only That Which Is Purposeful, Useful, And Rational. Everything You See, You See Through The rational mind. But an intuition, a discovery, new knowledge goes beyond the rational mind. Truth is beyond the rational mind.

The rational mind is like a railroad track that is fixed in grooves. A plane has no tracks. It can fly anywhere. A balloon can float anywhere.

Some people step out of the rational mind in order to rebel against society. They want to break social law but for the ego's sake. They do it out of anger, hatred, rebelliousness, and wanting attention. This is not stepping out of the rational mind (though they think it is).

We step out of the rational mind when we do something that has no purpose. Accepting that, as an act, makes it a game. Life becomes lighter. If you are stuck with only rational acts, life becomes a burden. Suppose you play a game without a thought to winning or losing, just act irrationally. Making an act without any purpose attached to it - it is freedom - like a dance.

So just step out of the rational mind and you will find a greater freedom, an unfathomable depth, and you willl come face to face with reality. Reality transcends logic and the rational mind. Until you transcend the rational mind you will not get access to creativity and the infinite.

But if you do an irrational act in order to find freedom, then it already has a purpose and a meaning. It is no longer irrational. This knowledge sheet has already spoiled it's own possibility.

Break the barrier of the rational mind and then find freedom for yourself.

NEWSFLASH! The Guru Magic worked magic in Botswana and South Africa. From Botswana where Sri Sri's talk made headlines in the newspapers, to Johannesburg and Durban where the Symposium on Human Values was attended by senior government officials and prominent religious leaders, the African tour has left crowds reeling.

IF YOU CANNOT MEDITATE, BE STUPID

If You Are Unable To Meditate, Your Mind Is Chattering Too Much And Nothing Works, Just Feel That You Are A little stupid. Then you will be able to sink deep.

Your intellect is a small portion of your total consciousness. If you are stuck in the intellect, you miss a lot. Happiness is when you transcend the intellect. Also, in awe or in feeling stupid, you transcend the intellect. Have you noticed mentally retarded people are more happy?

Question: How do you go beyond the intellect?

Answer: By acting stupid!

Everyone avoids being stupid, no one wants to look dumb. That is really stupid.

Stupidity should be followed by meditation, otherwise depression may follow.

GIVE AWAY YOUR RIGHTS

Those Who Fight For Their Rights Are Weak For They Do Not Know Their Inner Strength, Their Magnanimity. The weaker you are, the more you demand your rights. Asserting your rights makes you isolated and poor. People who fight for their rights, take pride in it. This is an ignorant pride. You need to recognize no one can take away your rights. They are yours.

The courageous will give away their rights. The degree to which you give away your rights indicates your freedom, your strength. The stronger you are the more you give away your rights. Only those who have their rights can give away their rights!!!

Demanding rights does not really bring you the rights, and giving them away does not really take them away.

Poor are those who demand their rights.

Richer are those who know their rights cannot be taken away.

Richest are those who give away their rights.

Demand for rights is ignorance, agony.

Knowing no one can take away your rights is freedom.

Giving away your rights is love, wisdom.

GENEROSITY IS THE QUALITY OF THE SPIRIT

When You Feel Stuck In Life And Not Growing, Bombarded By Desires, When There Is Dryness, Lack Of enthusiasm, no juice, what do you do?

Here is the solution....FEEL GENEROUS....right away, not tomorrow.

Either a princess or a pauper can feel generous. Generosity is the quality of the spirit. When you feel generous your life becomes abundant, full of compassion and love.

Question: Is generosity the same as being grateful?

Answer: No. Gratefulness always has self concern. You are grateful because you have something or you get something. Generosity is an expression independent of external circumstances. No one can make you feel generous. That is something that you have to do yourself. Essentially, generosity is not an act. It is a state of consciousness, but it cannot but find its expression in an act.

Question: What about passion?

Answer: Passion indicates scarcity. Dispassion is abundance. Dispassion without generosity makes you self-centered, causes more dryness.

You dont´ have to think about what you have done in the past. That only brings doership.

Just feel generous.

NEWS FLASH Following Guruj's visit to South Africa, there is now a very successful prison program going on.

The Path Of Surrender Is The Path Of Love

Krishna tells Arjuna, "You are very dear to me."

Then Krishna tells Arjuna he must surrender. Surrender begins with an

assumption. First you must assume. You assume you are the most beloved of the

Divine, and then surrender happens.

Surrender is not an action; it is an assumption. Non-surrender is

ignorance. Non-surrender is an illusion. So surrender is an assumption.

Surrender has to begin as an assumption and then it reveals itself as a

reality. Finally, it reveals itself as an illusion. An illusion because there

is no two, no duality.

There is no independent existence of anyone. An individual has no

independent existence. That is it!

Question: Do you have to go through surrender to realize it is an illusion?

Answer: Yes, absolutely.

Question: Where is choice then?

Answer: Choice is your destiny.

Krishna doesn't tell Arjuna in the beginning that he must surrender. First

he says, "You are so dear to me." And then he tells him, " There is no other

choice for you, you must surrender. Either you do it now, or you do it later."

This is the path of love.

It Takes Courage To Say "I Am"

Only in deep rest can the Divine come, not by doing. All the doings are to help you become silent. Not enjoying the bliss or the peace takes you further - otherwise the bliss or the peace can create cravings. If the existence wants to give it, then fine. It takes courage to say "I am". Your true nature is bliss. But trying to enjoy the bliss, you step down from is-ness to am-ness - "l am peaceful", "I am blissful". And that is followed by "I am miserable". "l am" is dispassion. You can be anywhere and be dispassionate. Dispassion is welcoming everything. Centeredness brings energy, a spark. Enjoyment of bliss brings inertia. If you are dispassionate, the bliss is still there. When the freezer is full of ice cream you do not bother about it. Dispassion takes away the sense of scarcity. Passion is a sense of lack of abundance. And whenever everything is abundance, dispassion happens. And when dispassion is there, everything comes in abundance.

Q: What do we do when we catch ourselves enjoying our bliss?

Guruji: Then we feel stupid. Just an understanding we are enjoying it, creates a shift. There is no effort. Knowledge is better than action to make you free.

To the sweet strains of Om Namo Bhagavate the course participants seemed to float across the stage for Guru Purnima blessings from Sri Sri.

Mercy indicates lack of intimacy. Indicates a distance; a lack of belongingness. You don't have mercy on your near and dear ones. You don't hear parents say, "l have mercy on my children." You have mercy on those who you think are not yours. Mercy indicates anger, judgment and authority. When you ask for mercy, you are self- centered. You want to be excused from the law of cause and effect. It also indicates lack of courage and valor.

At times mercy is an impediment to growth. Mercy, of course, brings some comfort and relief; but can impair the process of transformation. If the leaves were to ask for mercy from falling, they would not be transformed.

If someone is driving and is tired, they will stop at the rest area. But if they start living there, they will be arrested (laughter). Then the spot has not served its purpose.

Patti and Victoria, high on bliss, did not stop at the stop sign and the police mercilessly gave them a ticket (in India-memo). Do you know what? Victoria said, "Thank you." But the police woman told her to go to court and ask for mercy! (laughter)

When you know and trust the process of creation, you will simply rejoice. It is the small mind which superimposes its nature on the Divine mind. Only when you made a mistake and you think God is angry and judging you do you ever ask for mercy. The Divine is all knowing and all loving; there is no chance for mercy.

Do you know I have no mercy? When there is intimacy there is no place for mercy.

Satsang Program: Chant twelve minutes "Om Namo Bhagavate" and three minutes "Guru Om" at the weekly Satsang followed by short meditation.

NEWS FLASH: As the summer tour moved to the San Francisco Bay area the talks were sold out in advance and the crowds were swept away with knowledge and grace. Sri Sri visited "The Mystery Spot" and of course solved the mysteries. Three cities in Colorado followed with more standing room only crowds and joyous Satsangs. Record high temperatures followed the entourage as well as record high bliss. Montreal is next.

EGO IS ONLY AN ATOM

The "I" or ego in you is a tiny atom. If this atom is put with the body, the matter, it identifies with the matter. If this atom is put with the Being, the Infinite, it identifies with the Infinite.

When this atom, this ego, is associated with the material world, it becomes mundane. When it is associated with the spirit, it becomes Divine. It becomes shakti when associated with the Being, the Self. It becomes miserable when identified with the body.

You see, in a huge atomic reactor, it is just one tiny atom that is exploded. In the same way, in our whole body, there is just one little tiny atom of "I". And when this "I" explodes, that is when it becomes the light of the Self.

Usually we say, "I am miserable, " or "I am happy".

Shift this atom from identifying with the body and the conceptual world, to identifying with the Real World.



NEWSFLASH !

Ottawa, Canada's capital, was graced with the Master's presence for two action-packed days this past week, where his public talk on Human Values at the elegant Chateau Laurier made the TV evening news, and the Hindu Temple experienced a tidal wave of joy and bliss. Then our caravan moved on to the advanced course at the Montreal Ashram, where we set new attendance records with 450 course participants. All are amazed at how smoothly things have gone, and there is no question that this is all due to the Guru's grace. A group of devotees from Central America has everyone dancing at the lively satsangs this week in our spacious and colourful tent by the lake. Nature has cooperated by providing perfect weather all week, and no bugs! Everyone is happy amidst great celebration. Fireworks at the lake on Thursday night will mark the grand finale of the North American summer tour, as Guruji prepares to leave for Germany.

LOYALTY

Loyalty is the way in which a mature and integrated mind behaves. Loyalty indicates undivided wholeness of consciousness and shows richness of the mind. When the mind is not integrated it is feverish, disloyal and opportunistic. Disloyalty comes out of opportunism. Opportunism is short-sightedness of one's destiny. Integrity or wholeness is essential to be healthy. A divided mind will gradually lead to schizophrenia and other physical and mental disorders. Loyalty is a real strength and will have the support of nature in the long run.

Fear and ambitions are impediments to loyalty. Loyalty is needed both in the material and spiritual plane. Either to destroy, create or maintain any institution, group or society, loyalty is essential.

Loyalty means believing in the continuity of commitment. Honouring commitment is loyalty. It takes you beyond the duality of craving and aversion.

Responsibility, dedication, commitment are the limbs of loyalty.

A loyal mind is a 'yes'-mind. The purpose of asking questions is to get an answer. The purpose of all answers is to create a ...'yes'.... 'Yes' is an acknowledgement of knowledge. The 'yes'-mind is a quiet, holistic and joyful mind. The 'no'-mind is a agitated, doubting and miserable mind. Loyalty begins with a 'yes'-mind and starts to perish with a 'no'-mind.

Love

Do you love someone, because they are great or unique?I tell you - you are hopeless!

Why do you love someone? Is it because of their qualities or is it because of a sense of kinship or intimacy?

You can love someone for their qualities and not feel a sense of kinship. This type of love gives rise to competition and jealousy. Such is not the case when love arises out of kinship.

If you love someone for their qualities, then when the quality changes or you get used to the quality, love also changes. However, if you love someone out of kinship, because they belong to you, then that love remains for life-times.

People say "I love God, because He is great". This is no big thing. If God is found to be ordinary, just one of us, then your love for God collapses! If you love God, because He is yours, then however God is, whether He creates or destroys, you still love Him. The love for kinship is like the love for yourself.

Question	
:
Many people do not have love for themselves?
Answer	
:
No! It is the other way around. They love themselves so much, that they want better qualities and better appearance for themselves. This love of qualities makes them be hard on one self.
 
If love is based on the quality of a person, then the love is not stable - after sometime the qualities change and the love becomes shaky. Loving someone because of their greatness or uniqueness is Third-rate love. Loving someone because they belong to you, great or otherwise, is unconditional love.

Knowledge, Sadhana, Seva and Satsang help to bring about a sense of belonging in no time. When love springs forth from a sense of belongingness then the actions and qualities do not over shadow the love. Neither the qualities nor actions can be perfect all the time. Love and a feeling of kinship alone can be perfect.

Singing, Communication and Ego

There are three modes of communication: in head to head communication you talk, in heart to heart communication you sing, and soul to soul communication happens in silence.

When you meet with people, often you communicate from head to head. When you are with nature, you start singing, you communicate with nature from your heart. Often when you are with people you keep talking, blabbering, and you keep the communication on the level of the head only. But when you are with nature, you start humming and your communication comes through the heart. And when you are with the guru, you go blank and forget all the questions. Then communication comes through the soul in silence.

When you meet with people, you like to remain in the head, you seldom sing with people (other than when it is organised). Your ego obstructs you from singing. Many do not feel comfortable singing with people. When you sing with people then you descend to the heart level or feeling level. Some feel comfortable just listening to music. Some feel comfortable singing only when they are alone. Some sing to draw attention or to charm others. Some only want to join in when all the others are singing. All this singing comes from ego.

Bhajan means sharing, sharing from the deepest level of our existence. Bhajan is authentic sharing. If you could sing with people, then your ego shatters. Children can sing with people for they do not have ego. To sing with a stranger you have to be free of ego. Ego doesn't let you sing with a stranger. Head level is safe for the ego -heart level breaks the ego - soul level dissolves the ego. All communication gaps happen because of ego.

Exercise: when you are with people, rather then chatting just start singing and you can feel the shift of energy that is happening. If you want to have more fun, greet a stranger with a song.

EXPANSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS PEACE

Consciousness moving on the surface of the body is stimuli, which cause pleasure. When consciousness shrinks, then the sensation of pain and suffering arises. Suffering is the shrinking or contraction of consciousness.

When consciousness moves through the body in limited channels, pleasure is experienced. Repeated enjoyment of the stimuli causes inertia and dullness. Often cooks don't enjoy their own food. Listening to the same piece of music loses the charm, people in the sex industry don't enjoy sex. If the stimuli are observed, then consciousness expands and becomes peace. With awareness the stimuli lose their significance; whether they exist or not makes no difference. When the sun is there, then whether the candle is lit or not makes no difference. To realise that all pleasures are just stimuli and that you are more than the stimuli brings freedom.

Pain is nothing but consciousness wanting to expand and to become free. Freedom basically is liberation from the craving of the stimuli. Pain is not a permanent state. The natural tendency of consciousness is to expand, to become bliss. Like the natural tendency of water is to flow downward, and the natural tendency of air is not to be under pressure, the natural tendency of consciousness is to expand and to be at peace. Like the person who is an insomniac and has forgotten how to sleep, most of us have forgotten to be at peace and in bliss.

Question	
:
What about the pleasure in Satsang?
Answer	
:
The pleasure of Satsang takes you towards expansion.

DEPENDENCE, INDEPENDENCE, INTERDEPENDENCE AND ONENESS

The body is dependent on the whole creation. In society, somebody has to make clothes, produce electricity, drill for oil. The body cannot be independent of the world. For the body, dependency is absolute. When the Spirit identifies with the body, then it gets pinched and looks for independence. Mind, intellect, ego - they all look for independence.

In looking for independence often you get stuck in the ego and become more miserable. Most people are not aware of their dependency. When they become aware of their limitations and dependency, the desire for independence arises. Independence cannot be achieved unless you start moving from within. When you move within, you discover that you are interdependent. Individual Self/Soul/Jeeva is interdependence and in fact every wise person knows that everything is interdependent and that there is nothing like independence.

On one level dependency is a harsh reality. On another level, it is an illusion because there is nothing else but the Self. It's only when you don't feel oneness, belongingness that you want independence. The Self being non-dual, there is no question of dependence or independence. One who asks for independence is a beggar. One who knows that it is an illusion is a King. When the sense of belongingness is not well founded, then there is a volatile state in the life of a seeker. Then the ego finds some excuse to revert to smallness. It is not yet totally soaked in the totality of knowledge. As it is not used to it, the mind finds every little excuse to revert back to the ego and to be aloof and independent and separate and it would find any small fault and blow it out of proportion. Be aware of these tendencies and come what may, be strong in the commitment to the Satsang, the Path.

Question	
:
How about self-sufficiency?
Answer	
:
Self is sufficient and efficient. . . . [laughter]

Rest and Activity

Activity and rest are two vital aspects of life. To find a balance in them is a skill in itself. When to have what and how much to have is wisdom. Finding them in each other-activity in rest and rest in activity-is the ultimate freedom.

More tiring than the work itself is the memory of hard work. Thinking you have worked hard itself interferes with the quality of rest. Some people take pride in working hard without any results. And there are others who crave for long rest not knowing the rest is in non-doership. It is the quality of rest, even if it is short, that recuperates.

When rest is needed, your body will automatically take it. Resting, without thinking about the need for it, is more restful. Desirelessness, Dispassion, and Samadhi are the deepest rest.

Question	
:
Our work is very stressful. We don't get enough time for the family. What do we do?
Answer	
:
Do you spend quality time with your family? Even if you spend half an hour are you cordial and fully attentive to the needs of your family? It is not the length of time you spend with your family matters. What matters is the quality of time that you spend with them.
 
 
Thinking you need rest makes you restless.
Thinking you have to work hard makes you tired.
Thinking you have worked hard brings self pity.

DO IT TILL YOU BECOME IT !

Virtues have to be practised till they become your nature. Friendliness, compassion and meditation should continue as practices till you realise that they are your very nature.

The flaw in doing something as an act is that you look for a result. When it is done as your nature, you are not attached to the result and you continue doing it. An action that arises from your nature is neither tiring nor frustrating. For example, daily routines like brushing one's teeth or bathing are not even considered actions because they are so integrated into one's life. You do all this without doership. When Seva is made part of your nature, it happens without doership.

Question	
:
When do you realise that compassion, meditation and Seva are your nature?
Answer	
:
When you cannot be without it.
Wise men continue the practices just to set an example, even though for them, there is no need for any practices.

DO NOT CORRECT YOUR MISTAKES!

Wanting to correct a mistake brings doership and doership is the foundation for mistakes. Often, those who are trying to correct mistakes get caught up in more mistakes. Those who recognize their are mistakes are freed from them.

Often, when one acknowledges a mistake, one tries to justify it, without taking responsibility for it. And sometimes one accepts that one made a mistake and starts justifying it or feeling guilty about it. Mistakes get dropped when one is troubled by ones conscience (viveka) or grief.

There may be flaws in any action, any situation or any person. Treat a flaw as you would treat a flower. Just as a flower has to wither away after sometime, so does a flaw.

Yagna creates energy, energy creates consciousness, awareness. Heightened awareness brings you close to the reality and the reality is a witness.

To realize that everything is happening you need heightened awareness. And to bring about heightened awareness you have to increase the prana.

Prana can be increased through:

Fasting, fresh food
Pranayamas, Kriya, meditation
Silence
Cold water baths
Total exhaustion, not letting sleep take over
Emotional peaks
Presence of the Master
Singing and chanting
Giving without a givership, service without a doership
All of these together is Yagna.

THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF UNDERSTANDING

There are three kinds of understanding: intellectual understanding, experiential understanding and existential realization.

Intellectual understanding says yes, agrees. Experiential understanding feels, is obvious. Existential realization is irrefutable. It becomes your very nature.

All you hear will simply remain a jumble of words if there is no experiential understanding, which is more on the feeling level. You can know intellectually you are hollow and empty but sitting and feeling you are hollow and empty is totally different.

When one gets an experience, one wants to understand more about it and becomes a seeker. If you have only intellectual understanding, you will think you know it all. Most theologians are in this category.

Existential realization contains within it both experiential and intellectual understanding. But it is beyond both of these.

Question	
:
How do we get there?
Sri Sri	
:
There is no way. When the fruit becomes ripe, it falls.
Question	
:
What is doubt?
Sri Sri	
:
It is one part of the mind challenging the other part of the mind.
 

Bonus Knowledge Flash:
Although "there is no way," Guruji nonetheless gave some interesting clues about "the way" in a spontaneous discourse this week on the eight limbs of yoga. Following a noon - time meditation, in which some practitioners must have been busy "doing" or otherwise impatient for the final " Jai Guru Dev "

Sri Sri said: "You have to rejoice in the means. You have to love the means. Love is the goal; the means must also be lovable. Love springs when there is no effort, when all activities are shunned." More on this in the next Knowledge sheet.

Sri Sri theoretically is on vacation this week at the Montreal Ashram. To the untrained eye, however, his so-called vacation appears no different from his usual hectic schedule. Streams of visitors flow through his kutir all day long, and invariably come out beaming. How this happens continues to be the greatest mystery.

Guruji is visiting Halifax and surprised the devotees of Halifax. Halifax is far from Montreal and many devotees were unable to come to the ashram to see him. Guruji continually confirms in so many ways that he is indeed the embodiment of love and compassion.

THE CAUSE OF RETURN

Most of us come into this world with the seed in us, "It's not OK". And all our life we try to correct events, people and situations. How much can you correct? It's like trying to rearrange the clouds in the sky. This seed does not allow you to be happy, to smile from your heart, to be loving and loveable. It's there all the time like a thorn - irritating, irritating.

This seed, "It's not OK," brings you back into this world again and again. How do you burn this seed?

First recognize that it is there. This can happen in deep introspection and meditation.
Sometimes you feel your body, mind, intellect, memory and ego are also not OK. You justify them or find fault with them. These are also part of the world. Acknowledge what you see as an imperfection and offer it to the Divine.
Have faith in the infinite organizing power of the Supreme Intelligence and have the sincere feeling, "Let thy will be done." Then the seed, "It's not OK," gets burned. "Thy will be done" is a state of total contentment, a state of just love.
We need not even make it a statement about the future. "Thy will alone is happening now."

Question	
:
So everything happening is God's will?
Guruji	
:
Yes, including the thought, "This shouldn't be happening."
 

NEWS FLASH !

One evening this week, Guruji took a very long walk through the forest after dark. For the flock of devotees following Him, the experience seemed to be a metaphor for the spiritual path following the Guru blindly along a steep and narrow trail, through the pitch black darkness, without any idea of how to find our way, yet laughing merrily anyway.

Diwali (The Festival of Lights) was celebrated in fine style with fireworks over the lake, a candlelight procession and the Light of Lights illuminating our hearts. The trees are now nearly bare, but the colorless landscape of late fall is not nearly as bleak as the prospect of Guruji's departure this weekend.

We are happy to report that Art of Living courses have now started happening in El Salvador and Zimbabwe.

Last week's Bonus Knowledge Flash continued: "You have to rejoice in the means. You have to love the means. Love is the goal; the means must also be loveable. Love springs when there is no effort, when all activities are shunned. As long as there is karma - the impression to act, you have to act. When this tendency to act eases up, total effortlessness happens. In effortlessness, unconditional love dawns. And every life is aching for that love."

Appreciation

When do you appreciate someone? When they do something that is unusual,not ordinary, and not their nature. Isn't it so?

For example, when a wicked person doesn't create a problem then you appreciate them. Or, when somebody you think is not good does a good act, then you appreciate them. Also, when a good person does something extraordinary, then you appreciate them. If a child made you a cup of tea, you would appreciate it, but if a mother made the same cup of tea, you would not likely appreciate it because it is a normal act for her. In the same way, you appreciate getting a ride from someone you don't know, but you don't necessarily appreciate it from a bus driver.

In all these cases, those acts are temporary, out of character, or not their nature. So when you appreciate someone for something, you imply that it is not the way they are usually.

Robin	
:
What if a person wants to be appreciated?
Sri Sri	
:
That means that it is not in their nature, and that is why they want to be appreciated. If it is not coming from their nature it is an imposed act. So when you appreciate someone you simply imply that it is not their nature, it is not the way they usually are. It is a rare act or quality. Appreciation implies a sense of separateness or distance, so watch out when you appreciate someone!

WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF LOVE

When you love someone you dont see anything wrong in them. Even if you see some fault in them you justify the fault and say Well everyone does it, it is normal. You think you have not done enough for them. The more you do, the more you want to do for them. They are always in your mind. Ordinary things become extraordinary. For eg.

Kobe had a beautiful Satsang, then the group went to Tokyo and Guruji stayed with his classmate. Laudable team work made possible exuberant Satsangs filled with tears of love and gratitude.

The Purpose of Life

Our first and foremost commitment is to do seva (service) in the world.
If there is fear in your life, it is because of a lack of commitment.
If there is confusion in your life, it is because of lack of commitment.

The very thought I am here in this world to do seva (service), dissolves the i and when the i dissolves, worries dissolve. Seva is not something u do out of convenience or for pleasure. The ultimate purpose of life is to be of service.

An uncommitted mind is miserable. A committed mind may experience rough weather but will reap the fruits of its toil.

When you make the service your sole purpose in life, it eliminates fear, brings focus in your mind and purposefulness, action and long term joy and may be short term problems!

AUSTERITY

Austerity is often mistaken to be poverty, self-denial. It is neither.
Austerity comes out of maturity. It is a sign of social health.

Often people who practice austerity are resentful of richness. This is a very pitiable state. Such austerity is not born out of maturity but out of compulsion. The true austerity has tolerance for richness and is never resentful.

In fact, one who is mature will have pity for one who is not austere. Austerity is not against celebration and just vanity is not celebration.

Celebration dawns in the spirit. Only one who is rich in spirit can practice austerity. One may be rich materially but if he is poor in spirit he can neither celebrate nor evolve.

Poverty of spirit is vanity. Austerity brings freedom from the pride of vanity. But taking pride in austerity is again a vanity !

Austerity comes out of abundance, and austerity brings abundance. If you feel a lack in any area of life, immediately start austerity. Austerity not only brings freedom but nurtures sharing and caring.

FOCUS AND EXPANSION

Focus sharpens the mind and relaxation expands the mind. Just an expanded mind without sharpness cannot bring the holistic development. At the same time, just the sharp mind without expansion causes tension, anger and frustration.

The balance between the focussed mind and expanded consciousness brings perfection.

Both Sudarshan Kriya and the Advanced Course techniques are aimed at developing such consciousness which is sharp and unbounded.

Seva and commitment play a major role in this. Also, food and attitude have an effect.

Expanded consciousness is peace and joy. Focussed consciousness is love and creativity.

A point of focussed consciousness is Individual self.

When every atom of the expanded consciousness becomes sharp, focussed, that is the awakening of Divinity.

SUBLIMATING LUST

Lust is one of the main botherations that many face. Lust grips the mind and tires the body, and dulls the intellect.

Lust when indulged brings inertia, and when suppressed brings anger. Lust is nothing but primordial un-harnessed energy. The same when harnessed manifests as enthusiasm, sparkle, sharpness of intellect and love.

What are the factors which can sublimate or transform lust into love?

Playfulness : People who are in the grip of lust cannot be genuinely playful. When you are genuinely playful, then there is not lust there.
Generosity : When you realize that you are here only to give and give, and you feel that you are very generous, lust is sublimated. Lust makes one possessive and not generous.

Creation returned to the source as Sri Sri visited Shimoga, the birthplace of the Art of Living, to a tumultuous traditional welcome. The course participants from 1982 met Guruji saying that their every single wish has been granted, and thanked him for the enormous grace and joy that their lives are filled with. A grand satsang there began a hectic, fun-filled week for Sri Sri and all of us.

Guruji stopped in Shringeri overnight and met with the Shankaracharya, they had a silent dialogue!

In Mangalore, Guruji's first ever Satsang had over 4000 people, and an elaborate welcome with the sound of huge horns.

On to Kerala, known as "God's own country", where the picturesque country-side and thousands of enthusiastic devotees greeted the Master ecstatically. Thallassery had its first ever Satsang, and Calicut saw thousands thronging the hall. On this trip, Sri Sri has astonished organisers and delighted audiences by speaking in the local language (Malayalam) - which he is not supposed to know!!

Trissur, the cultural capital of Kerala, welcomed Sri Sri with caparisoned elephants, traditional drums and horns, and had a moonlit, open-air Satsang of over 10,000! Of course many healing experiences are being reported. Even as Sri Sri is making headlines in all the leading newspapers, many amazing/amusing incidents have been "happening".

Guruji stopped the car at a small village, and was immediately surrounded by the locals. One of them said that after seeing Guruji's photo in the newspaper, he had been praying to Guruji ever since. His joy new no bounds when Guruji visited his tiny shop and blessed him.

Earlier, an autorickshaw driver was doing pranam to Guruji's poster -imagine his surprise when he turned and saw Guruji smiling from the car next to him!

Uncertainty

You can be at ease with the uncertainty of the world when you realise the certainty of the consciousness. Often people do just the opposite. They are certain about the things in the world and uncertain about God. They rely on something that is not reliable and get upset. Uncertainty causes craving for stability and the most stable thing in the universe is our Self.

The world is of change, the Self is of non-change. You have to rely on the non-change and accept the change. If you are certain that everything is uncertain, then you are liberated. When you are uncertain in ignorance then you become worried and tense. Uncertainty with awareness brings higher states of consciousness and a smile.

Bharat says: A certain smile!!!

Often people think that certainty is freedom. If you feel that freedom when you are not certain then that is 'real' freedom. Often your certainty or uncertainty is based on the relative world. To be certain about the uncertainty of the relative, makes you certain about the existence of the absolute and brings a 'certain' faith in the absolute. Nitin says: Yes, to understand this you certainly need to have awareness!!!

Question	
:
Can we still be enthusiastic when we are uncertain?
Sri Sri	
:
Yes, in knowledge you can be enthusiastic in uncertainty. Often people who are uncertain dont act, they simply sit and wait. Acting in uncertainty makes life a game, a challenge. Being in uncertainty is letting go. Certainty about the relative world creates dullness. Uncertainty about the Self creates fear. Uncertainty about matter brings certainty about consciousness.

In Cochin, by the ocean, a grand open-air satsang of over twelve thousand had a full moon shining on the sea of devotees. The next day, Kollam, the cashew hub of India, saw thousands flock to the noontime Satsang in spite of it being a working day. Then the party zone moved to Trivandrum the capital of Kerala where Sri Sri was welcomed with caparisoned elephants, umbrellas and deepa balikas (girls holding lamps) and the King. Over fifteen thousand people were present and yet there was pindrop silence during meditation. The program was telecast live. Then onto Varkala for a morning satsang enroute to Kanyakumari the southernmost tip of India where the three seas meet. The next day the entire town of Udayankulangara celebrated Guruji's brief stopover and a feast was arranged for the entire township. A very famous painter who was making a portrait of Sri Sri for a billboard felt strong currents in his body as he was giving the finishing touches and started crying.

ORGANIZATION

The entire creation is a huge organization. Everything is made up of atoms. The whole world is nothing but organization, where the atoms have decided to organize themselves in a specific pattern to form a particular substance. And those particular patterns bring them specific qualities.

Death/decay/transformation happens when the atoms get bored of patterns and decide to recognise themselves.

e.g. : When the atoms of the apple say "Enough of being an apple", that's when the rotting starts. If there is never boredom of patterns, there can be no decay.

The movement from one organized state to another is also organized. This is the transient organization which we call chaos. This transient organization may need a catalyst. Knowledge is such a catalyst.

So, you have absolutely no escape from organisation.

RECYCLING and HYGIENE

Everything here is recycled. The earth is 200 million years old - the Alps, the water, the air. Billions of people have breathed the same air. All the particles in your body are old, you are recycled. Your thoughts and emotions are recycled, mind is recycled. You are a recycled person.

Everything here is recycled. Consciousness is recycled - its the same old consciousness. Remind yourself that everything here is recycled material - so relax! Everything goes to where it came from. Recycling brings back purity and hygiene. Knowledge recycles the mind.

Tarah says	
:
Recycling makes everything new and therefore a mind that is recycled by knowledge finds everything fresh.
Knowledge keeps everything fresh. That is why you can keep recycling the same creation. A mind in Knowledge finds everything fresh. If you dont put Knowledge to the mind, the mind gets rotten. Knowledge brings the mind back to purity. Recycling brings purity and hygiene.

Hygiene supports health, and too much hygiene destroys health. In a too hygienic situation the immune system in the body becomes like lazy, unequipped soldiers. People who live in slums often dont get sick, because their immune system becomes like a well-trained soldier. Often people who are too fussy about hygiene have poor health. Sometimes unhygienic conditions create health. It keeps your immune system active, alive and strong, while Knowledge keeps your mind fresh.

After a grand satsang in Madras the group went to the Chidambaram temple, the place of the cosmic dance of SHIVA. Then on to the temple town of Kumbakonam for a big satsang, also known as the seat of Vedic knowledge, where Guruji honored many Vedic pundits and meditations were held in many ancient temples. Then the satsang army marched on to Papanasam, Guruji's birthplace, where everyone played in the water - shooting missiles of bliss. Then on to Trichy for an invigorating satsang. People were well fed up in the temples. In spite of the tour being hectic the whole group of 80 was so energetic and enthusiastic. Guruji was received by the temple authorities at the Sri Rangam temple and honored by the pontiff of the Vaishnava tradition, who was visibly moved. Then the troupe moved on to Madhurai where the elephants garlanded Guruji to the beat of the drums on the premises of the famous Minakshi temple, for a jubilant satsang with more than 8000 people who were spell-bound in a great meditation. Next morning the entire town of Rajapalayam celebrated a long awaited (seven years) satsang with Guruji. Before noon the group left for Udimalpet where many seva projects had been launched. Again a big satsang with several 1000 people. The next morning there was a live kriya and satsang for about 2500 people and the group went to Pollachi for the grand, final satsang of the tour. Then the caravan of buses and cars left for Bangalore and Guruji left for Madras, where a gentlemen came to meet him with an ancient, 5000 year old palm leaf script which mentioned the name of Guruji, and the immense grace that flows through him and protects and transforms the life of millions. Then Guruji came to the European ashram Bad Antogast in Germany.

BLISS

Bliss cannot be understood. It is extremely difficult to get into bliss. After many lifetimes you get into bliss. It is even more difficult to get out of bliss. All that you seek in your life is bliss, that divine union with your source, and everything else in the world distracts you from that goal. There are a zillion things to distract you from that goal in so many ways. So many unexplainable, incomprehensible ways of not coming home.

The mind is kept alive by cravings and aversions - shoulds or should nots and wants. Only when the mind dies does the bliss dawn. Bliss is the abode of all divinity, all devas. It is possible only in this human body to comprehend, to uphold, and having had a human life and having known this path, if you still do not realize this - you are at the greatest loss. The cravings and aversions make your heart hard. There is no use in being polite in your behavior. You can be rude in your behavior but you cannot be rough in your heart. If you are rude in your behavior, it is acceptable, but not if you are rough in your heart. The world does not care how you are inside. It only looks to your behavior. The Divine does not care how you are outside – It only looks to your inside. Never let any tiny bit of dislike or craving house in your heart. Let it be fresh, soft and fragrant like a rose.

It is such an illusion – you dislike someone or something, and this only makes you hard and your hardness takes a long time to soften, to disappear. It is such a trap for keeping you away from the treasure. Nothing in this material world can give you contentment. An outer-looking mind seeking for contentment gets discontented and the discontentment grows, and complaints and negativity start hardening the brain, clouding the awareness (the aura), and forming a huge cloud of negative energy. When the negativity reaches its peak, like an overloaded balloon, it bursts and comes back to the Divinity. You can never escape the Divine, the long route of negativity, or the instantaneous positive approach. When the Divinity dawns, in no time the shift happens from the untruth to truth, from darkness to light, from the dull inert matter to the sparkling spirit. When the heart is hard, there is no fun. You cannot experience fun.

DO YOU TEST GOD, OR DOES GOD TEST YOU?

Testing is part of ignorance. You only test that of which you are not sure. If God is testing you, that means God doesn't´ know you well enough. How could people ever think that God is testing them?

God does not test you because he knows you in and out and your past, present and future. He knows your strengths and weaknesses and he alone gives you strength. He doesn't test you.

Only you can test yourself. Only when you do not have confidence, then you test. If you are confident, why would you test? If you are testing yourself, you do not know yourself.

Are you testing God?

God will never pass your test because He will never show up for your test. If He shows up for your test, then He is not God (laughter).

WELCOMING AND RESISTING

Do you welcome all that comes to you or do you resist it? If you cannot resist anything, you cannot welcome anything! You cannot resist everything and you cannot welcome everything!

You don't welcome all thoughts that come to your mind. When you welcome a thought, it means you find it good and act on it. If you act on all thoughts that come to your mind, you will end up in a mental hospital or in prison. So, you resist or ignore some thoughts and welcome other thoughts. You need discrimination in life. Welcoming and resisting is a swing in life.

Welcoming is essential for expansion and growth, and resistance is essential for maintenance.

Audience: But what you resist persists!

Guruji: If you resist a cold it does not persist! If there is no resistance in your body you cannot survive. Your body resists something and welcomes something.

Where the resistance is weak, the persistence happens. A weak resistance makes the opposition persist. A strong resistance erases the opposition. Strong resistance leads to valour, power and samadhi (equanimity). It brings in you the strength of a warrior. Nothing can tempt you, nothing can obstruct you. Then the victory is gained without fighting. Where there is strong resistance or total welcome, the victory is gained without any fighting.

STIMULATING THE SOUL

When a part of the body is stimulated, pleasure arises. When your soul is stimulated, love arises. Love has no end but pleasure ends. Often people think pleasure is love. Distinction between pleasure and love has to be understood, only the luckiest one will understand.

Like you eat sugar and stimulate the tongue, music stimulates the ears and sight stimulates the eyes. And what stimulates the soul? Sadhana and Satsang is what stimulates the soul!

All that one wants is the stimulation of the soul. Even a faint idea of it keeps life going. Every other stimulus is on the surface. The stimulus of the soul energizes and the stimulus of the body brings tiredness. Every stimulus should lead you to the self so that when you listen to music, you transcend the music, and when you listen to Knowledge it takes you to the Silence.

If you do not know emptiness then you cannot know the joy of the Being. The knack of experiencing the Being causes emptiness. From the emptiness begins the fullness.

LOVE'S WISDOM

I chant the name of my beloved in every breath. The beloved is faultless - perfect. But being in love I have lost my reputation.When there is so much love, you take total responsibility for any misunderstanding. You may express dismay for a moment on the surface. But when you do not feel that in your heart, you arrive at a perfect understanding. You are in a state where all problems and differences slide away and only love shines through.

Usually we get stuck in our differences, because we have lost sight of ourselves. In the name of love we try to manipulate and control the other person. This is natural that when we love somebody, we want them to be perfect.

You can never see the pits in the ground from the top of a hill. From a plane the earth looks so smooth. So also from a state of elevated consciousness, you do not see the pitfalls in others. But if you come to the ground you always see the holes. And when you want to fill the holes, you have to see them. You cannot build a home being airborne. You cannot till the land without looking at the pits, filling them, removing the pebbles....

That is why when you love somebody you find all the faults in them. But finding faults destroys love. Instead of filling the pits we run away from them. When you love somebody and see their faults, stay with them and help them fill the pits. This is wisdom.

BECOMING DEFENSELESS

Whenever a boundary is broken, it creates some fear. The fear creates dislike. This dislike puts us back in the boundary. And to keep yourself in the boundary you put forth defenses. When you try to defend your position, it is such a stress, isn't it? And every time you try to defend your position it makes you more and more weak.

On the path, people even use the Knowledge as a defense against criticism! Don't use Knowledge as a defense.

The Knowledge is like an umbrella for you -- a shelter, not a weapon. Of course, sometimes "Don't use Knowledge as a weapon" becomes an excuse not to be in Knowledge! (Laughter)

I say, drop all your defenses. Anybody can make a mistake. Even you!

Don't defend your mistakes. Just accept them and move on. When you are totally defenseless, that's when you'll be strong.

DIKSHA

Initiation is called "Diksha". In Sanskrit "Di" means intellect. "Ksha" means the horizon r the end. "Diksha" means transcending the intellect.

Education is called "Shiksha", the horizon of discipline - total discipline. Discipline is needed for education. "Diksha" is needed for meditation.

A Teacher gives "Shiksha". A Guru gives "Diksha". A Guru takes you beyond intellect to the Realm of Being. It is a journey from the Head to the Heart.

Blossoming beyond the intellect is "Diksha". If you do not go beyond the intellect, you will not smile, you will not laugh. Once "Diksha" happens, you are happy, blissful and contented; and thirst for knowledge is quenched.

Totality of Discipline is "Shiksha"

LOVE AND LUST

Doubt cannot come where there is a sense of closeness. Doubt needs a distance to appear. You never doubt something that is dear to you, close to you.

In love even an object gains life. Stones speak to you, trees speak to you, the sun, the moon and the whole creation becomes alive, Divine. In lust even a living being becomes a mere object. You want to use even people like objects. Here are some salient attributes of love and lust. They are so different yet so close! If you find more you may add to the list.

Lust bring tension	Love brings relaxation
Lust focuses on the part	Love focuses on the whole
Lust brings violence	Love brings sacrifice
In lust you want to grab and possess	In love you want to give and surrender
Lust says all I want you to have is what I want	Love says I want you to have what you want
In lust there is effort	Love is effortless
Lust causes feverishness and frustration	Love causes longing and pain
Lust imprisons and destroys	Love liberates and sets you free
Lust demands	Love commands
Lust gets you mixed up and confused	In love you are focused and spaced out!!
Lust is only dark and monotonous	Love has many modes and colours
 

If someone's lust is interrupted they get angry and start hating. Hatred in the world today is not out of love, it is out of lust.

Love is playfulness and in lust there is cunningness and manipulation. Shiva, the embodiment of innocence and love was meditating. His meditation was disturbed by an arrow of flowers from the lord of lust. As soon as Shiva woke up he opened his third eye and the lord of lust, Manmatha (one who churns the mind) was reduced to ashes. Everybody celebrated by throwing colors on each other realising that life is full of colours.

We play many roles in our life. If all the roles get mixed up it becomes dark, like when you mix all the colours. The wise play each role distinctively side by side, like colors displayed side by side form a rainbow.

The moment you doubt, it is no longer dear to you; a distance has come.

INTELLIGENCE

The first sign of intelligence is not to begin anything! (Not to be born at all!)

Having lost this first sign, the second sign of intelligence is - once you have started something, see it through to the end.

The short-sighted ones look for short-term benefits. Far sighted ones look for long-term benefits.

Whether you consider yourself intelligent or not, there is no escape from SEVA (service), for Seva gives immediate satisfaction as well as long-term merit.

NEWS FLASH Each country is asked to choose one particular month in a year to organise a community lunch or dinner once every week.

ATTAINING SELF-KNOWLEDGE

Desire, awareness of the Self and action all are manifestation of the same energy that is you. Among these three, one of them dominates at a time. When you have lots of desires, you are not aware of the Self. When desire dominates, Self-awareness will be at its lowest, and that's why all the philosophers around the world have always advocated renunciation and dropping of desires. When the awareness is dominant, then happiness dawns. When desire dominates, stress and sorrow result. When actions dominates, restlessness and disease is the result. When your actions and desires are sincerely directed to the Divine or to the welfare of society, then the consciousness is automatically elevated, and Self - knowledge is sure to be attained.

NEWS FLASH !

India has stepped into the 52nd Century of Krishna's time. On 18th March began our year 5101 and a great celebration is happening everywhere. The "Sun" of knowledge dawns ever brighter in this holy valley of Rishis, and sets in a Kaleidoscope of daughter, joy, celebration and bliss. The purity of the holy waters has inspired a new "wave" of Pranayama.

Many healing experiences have been shared amidst tears of gratitude....."Cancelled" Cancers, disappearing depressions.. A heart patient spent Rs.4 lakhs in hospital in Bombay and was given 5 months to live. Rs. 500/- and a 5 day course! Two years of enthusiastic living and he is still going strong - hale and hearty! A program to teach 400 youth has been launched all over rural India, for the implementation of the 5-H program.

Many new books of Guruji's precious knowledge have now been released in Hindi.

YOU AND YOUR TIME

When you feel time is too short, you are either restless or in expanded awareness. When you feel time is too long, you are miserable or keen minded. When you are happy and love what you are doing, you simply don't feel the time. Also, in sleep you don't feel the time.

In deep meditation, you are the time and everything is happening in you. Events are happening in you like the clouds come and go in the sky.

When you are ahead of time, it is dragging and boring. When the time is ahead of you, then you are surprised and shocked. You cannot digest the events.

When you are with the time, you are wise and at peace.

Narayana Sharma says, "Guruji, you spend a good time with us!"

Next week we will see how to manage time or how the time manages us.

 

NEWS FLASH: Busloads of people arrived in Rishikesh for Mahakriya and Mahasatsang - a grand finale for Guruji's Rishikesh visit. At the India Habitat Center in Delhi, Union Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament, Judges and Bureaucrats and other dignitaries attended Guruji's talk and were so happy that they all came back the next day for a jubilant Satsang in a hall packed to three times the normal capacity.

Guruji's first visit to the mountain kingdom of Nepal - He was received at the airport by the Prime Minister's Emissary and later had a meeting with the Prime Minister. An impressive dignitary's meeting was followed by an ecstatic satsang of nearly 3000.

Over to Chennai down Southern India, Sri Sri presided over India Heritage '99, a special conference of Temple Administrators. In his sparkling keynote address, he enlightened the guardians of Temple Heritage on the newer ways to bring about fusion of spiritual and cultural dimensions.

A PRAYER

Give me not thirst if you cannot give me water.
Give me not hunger if you cannot give me food.
Give me not joy if I cannot share.
Give me not the skills if I cannot put them to good use.

Give me not intelligence if I cannot perceive beyond it.
Give me not knowledge if I cannot digest it.
Give me not love if I cannot serve.
Give me not desire that doesn't lead me to you.
Give me not a path that doesn't take me home.
Give me not a prayer if you don't want to hear it. (Laughter)

Question

THE NOISE OF NON-VIOLENCE

Often violence comes with noise. Non-violence happens in silence. People who are violent make huge noise; they make it  known.  People who are non-violent are quiet. But the time has come for people who are non-violent to make noise so that the violence will quiet down. The message of non-violence has to come loud and clear so that it can be heard from a young age.

A sense of shame has to be connected with anger and violence. The reason for violence in young people is a sense of pride in anger and violence, not a sense of shame. People feel proud that they are violent or angry. They think it is prestigious or a status symbol to be aggressive. Aggression is not thought to be a quality to be ashamed of. This promotes aggression and violence in the whole society, and when aggression and violence are promoted, human values diminish. Some movies and modern music glorify frustration, anger and revenge and make these a role model for children.

We need to promote human values especially love compassion and belongingness loud and clear. Speak to groups or through your local media in the newspaper and on TV and create as many Art Excel and Art of Living courses in your area as possible.

David asks	
:
"If people are ashamed to be angry, won't that keep them unnatural and set up resistance in them that will persist?"

 	 
Sri Sri	
:
"If they are not ashamed, they will feel a free license to get angry and violent. Sometimes resistance is a good thing (Like resistance to disease or resistance to bad habits)."
 	 
 

 

 

 

NEWS FLASH: Sri Sri continued on from Kauai, Hawaii to the Island of Oahu, Hawaii where an advanced course, public Satsangs and meetings with government leaders awaited Him. The Hawaiian Prison Smart program continues to flourish and other new programs for government agencies are being planned. Sri Sri spoke at a luncheon honoring volunteer service leaders, was interviewed on NBC-TV and was invited to speak at a youth conference with delegates from over 100 countries. The traveling Satsang then made its way to the mainland and a warm welcome from our Art of Living community in Apple Valley, California.

LIFE IS TOO SHORT
LIFE IS ETERNAL

The realization that life is very short brings dynamism in your life. Unwanted things will fall off as well as distractions. When you have to be acting or putting out effort, know that life is short. When you are expecting a result, then you are often frustrated. The ignorant person does it the other way: He hurries for the result and is impatient. Impatience goes away when you know that life is eternal. When you are looking for a return of a favor from someone or a result from your good deed, you want it quickly. When you realize life is short, procrastination falls away. But when you know that there are many lifetimes, you realize that if you don't get it sooner, you get it later. Wake up and see your life is too short. Time is running so what are you doing with your life? Is it being useful to you and the world around you? Realize life is too short. WAKE UP! LIFE IS ETERNAL!


When you want to enjoy the fruit of action know that life is eternal. When it comes to hope, you should know that there are many lifetimes. When you are looking for results, know that time is eternal. If someone doesn't thank you or takes advantage of you, thank them because they will pay you back later with interest. So no one needs to feel sorry that they have been taken advantage of or unappreciated. Know that they will have to be paying you back in the future with interest! When it comes to enjoying the fruit of your actions, good deeds or even blessings, know that life is eternal. Anytime that you are in a hurry, you cannot enjoy. So know that life is eternal.

 

NEWS FLASH: In addition to the jubilee and satsangs in Apple Valley, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Monterey, Berkeley and and San Jose, Guruji spoke on human values in the 20th century at the University of California in Santa Barbara. A new initiative to promote Art Excel in high schools and colleges throughout the USA has begun.

A DEEP REST

You cannot rest when you have to do something which you cannot. And you cannot rest when you feel you have to be someone whom you are not. You are not required to do what you cannot. You will not be asked to give what you cannot give. Nothing is expected of you that you cannot do. Doing service involves only doing what you can do. And no one wants you to be someone whom you are not.

This realization brings you deep rest. You cannot rest if you have either ambition or lethargy. Both are opposed to good rest. A lazy person will toss and turn at night and be "rest-less" and an ambitious person will burn inside.

This rest brings up your talents and abilities and brings you closer to your nature. Even a slight feeling that the Divine is with you brings deep rest.

And prayer, love and meditation are all flavors of deep rest.

NEWS FLASH: Sri Sri's American tour picked up speed as it move first to San Jose with a day long advanced course and an evening program for the Indian community, and then to a weekend advanced course in Wisconsin where many tears of joy were shed. Then the travelling satsang moved on in rapid fashion to Kansas City, New Jersey and New York. The next day took on the feeling of an adventure as Sri Sri cruised north through New England, with a picnic lunch in New Haven, several wrong turns and a happy arrival in Boston in late afternoon. Tomorrow Sri Sri speaks at Harvard University on the topic of children, violence and our Art Excel program.

FAITH: A QUALITY OF UNDIVIDED CONSCIOUSNESS

That in which you have faith, do not make it an object of knowing. Faith is the nature of undivided mind, undivided consciousness. We have faith in God, do not try to know God. We have faith in Self, do not try to know Self. You can't have faith in that which you make an object of knowing. A thing to know is an object of knowing. You have made it into an object of knowing. Whatever you have faith in, you do not need to know about it. Do not make that something you have faith in, an object of knowing. Like you have faith in God, you cannot make God an object of knowing; like you have faith in yourself, you can't make the Self an object of knowing.

Q. Are faith and belief the same?
Guruji: Belief is a little diluted, faith is little strong, more concrete. Our beliefs can change, faith is firm. Faith is yogurt, belief is buttermilk. (Laughter....)

Like a child has faith in the mother, the child does not make the mother into an object of knowing. The child does not try to know the mother, it simply has faith in the mother. When you have faith, what is the need to know it? You cannot make love an object of knowing, if you try to make love an object of knowing, if you try to know it, it will disappear.

In the same way you cannot make Self, or God an object of knowing. God, love, sleep, and Self are beyond knowing. If you try to analyze, doubt comes in and faith will disappear. So whatever you want to have faith in, do not want to know it or analyze it. The moment you make something an object of knowing then analysis starts and then doubt follows. Analysis creates a distance, synthesis brings it together. Faith is synthesis, knowing is analysis.

Barbara: Can you have faith without being aware of it?
Guruji: Yes. You have faith. Consciousness cannot exist without faith. Faith is a relaxed, stable, quality of consciousness. It is like the flame of a candle. The nature of consciousness is faith.

Theologians analyze too much. They study 5 to 6 years and then they lose their faith.

A story: Jyoti once met an officer in-charge of religious affairs. The minister was so sure that no one can have spiritual experiences. She gave him a short talk on spirituality and she concluded by saying, "I believe in what I experience." His comment was, "I am glad to hear that you too are an
atheist!" Another ANALYSIS by a theologian has recently concluded that Jesus never existed.

Nick: Does God have faith in us?
Guruji: I don't know?!! (Laughter - very non-analytical!!) To know whether God has faith or not, you have to analyze. If you ask whether God has faith in us then you give God also a mind, which is not true.


NEWS FLASH: The guru as usual with his love and grace charmed the French people in their capital city. After the wonderful course in Paris everyone went for Satsang in the boat on the river Seine. The following evening many ambassadors and dignitaries attended a conference on human values which Guruji addressed. For the first time there will be Ayurvedic treatment combined with the basic course at the end of July. This will be a one week residential course in Bad Antogast, which is still sparkling with the guru's presence!

SUCCESS

Q.: How was yesterday's program? Was it successful?

Guruji: There is no question of success if you have nothing to gain. There is nothing to gain if you have only come to give and serve. Success indicates non-supremacy. Success means what? It indicates that there are chances of failure. If something is supreme there is nothing to lose. People running after success only exhibit their limitations.

Success means crossing a limit. To cross a limit you need to assume that you have a limit. Assuming a limit is underestimating yourself. If you have no boundaries then where is your success? If you have limitless access then there is no success. You don't say that you successfully drank a glass of water, because it is well within your capabilities. But when you do something that is beyond your perceived limits you claim success.

When you realise your unboundedness then no action is an achievement.

Anyone who claims to be successful only reveals his limitation. If you feel very successful it means that you have underestimated yourself. All your gains can only be smaller than you. Taking pride in any gains is belittling yourself.

Sheila: What if you feel that you are not serving successfully?

Guruji: You may feel that you have not done enough but you will not feel that you have not been successful. Real service is when you feel that you have not done enough.

Kai: You are not very successful! (Laughter)

Guruji: I am just full!

MESSAGE

Question: Guruji, what is your message?

Guruji: I have no message. In order to give a message you have to be far away. Message needs a distance. Message is of the past or of the future. Message is impersonal and lifeless. Knowledge cannot be a message. The wise one will not give you a message, but will simply awaken you.

God will not give you a message. For God to give you a message, God has to be so far away from you. God is more close to you than your breath. How can He give you a message?

The wise neither need a message nor give a message. The unwise would give a message and want a message -- and would be unable to use the message anyway. Whoever needs the message will not use it. And one who can use the message wouldn't need it!

Jim asks, "What is the difference between Knowledge and message?"

You can read about living in the moment so many times, but it only becomes knowledge when you experience it. Like you can read the ingredients, but when you taste it, the information becomes Knowledge.

Jim says, "These Knowledge sheets really cut down on our communication." (Laughter!)

Transforming the Crisis in Education: Coming Home

(see last weekÒ³ Knowledge sheet for the schedule of events)

The 3 day conference being held at the Ashram during the second week of the summer courses will provide the first truly in-depth look into the direction being taken by the organization addressing our program for children. Unveiled will be the curricula for the ashram School, set to open its doors in autumn of the year 2000, and we will encourage all conference participants to lend us their vision of an ideal school, a school that will be the exact result of the heart-labors put into it by its supporters. So, we are calling on those parents and educators (and generally those interested in the future of our society) to bring their support and their ideas to this conference which proposes to give children the A.R.T. EXCEL experience all-year long. Please come and share your vision with us.

This conference, being held the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of July, is offered at no extra fee, and only to those who are here at the Ashram participating in one of the courses taking place during the second week of courses this summer. This is a perfect adjunct to, but not a replacement for, A.R.T. EXCEL Teacher's Training (being held the first week). We are so fortunate to be in the very eye of this storm of knowledge that is right now already transforming the society in which we live. And how fortunate for our children -- the next generation.

Just to keep people abreast of the registration proceedings at the ashram; for the second week the residence building Bodhisattva has been filled, and the two women's cabins have been filled. So bear in mind that when registering, for a fair amount of people, this will mean that you will be registering for either camping or the condos. Please feel free to contact Sage or Judith at the Ashram for more detailed and up-to-the-minute information.

**Special Note: Gurudev has requested that a limit on the number of people coming to the ashram be placed. Therefore, all applications will be handled on a first-come first-served basis and must be accompanied with full payment. Again, please recall that phone messages, faxed messages, or emails will not reserve a place on the summer courses, only the full registration process suffices. Please act quickly to reserve your space.

MAHA SEVA: All people who have any time at all to spare or donations to give are requested to contact the Ashram as quickly as possible in response to Guruji's request that the grounds be cleaned and prepared and generally beautified in order to receive various delegates and honored guests to visit during the time of the summer programs.

BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO ARE BORED

Only a conscious, alert and dynamic person can get bored. A dull and inert person doesn't get bored. If you get bored, it indicates you are more alive and human. It is a sign that you are growing, that you are evolving.

An animal, for example, keeps doing the same thing. It never gets bored. Cows, horses, birds do the same things over and over all their lives.

People eat, watch television, change jobs, change partners to escape boredom. And they get frustrated. And frustration takes them back to inertia and unconsciousness.

Only in two states the boredom does not occur: in a state of total inertia or in a state of Divine Consciousness. If you are bored, it indicates you are evolving. Boredom moves you.

Jim: Boredom moves you towards the divine.

Guruji: Yes. Be proud of your boredom and celebrate!!!!!!

Volcanic NEWS FLASH

Maybe you are bored listening to "the hall was packed" all the time.... Well, in Bogota, Colombia, about 100 people showed up for a morning lecture at the university. The microphone came at the end and so did most of the people! About 12 showed up for another university talk, but Guruji was not there. In contrast, the evening Satsang was so crowded and there was much confusion. The meditation was reduced to 5 minutes as many had to keep standing. [McQueen went on strike and refused to write this news flash because it was too factual. (laughter)]

The Dominican Republic's devotion and organizing power pulled Guruji on an 11-hour marathon to reach them. After his last minute trip to the ocean, Guruji boarded the plane soaking wet. In Panama the warmth of the Latin-American hearts and songs lit up the Satsangs. In Costa Rica Guruji had a diplomatic reception and a motorcycle escort, and his talk was co-sponsored by the University of Peace and the National Commission for Human Values. The first Lady, on behalf of the president, received Guruji at the palace and extended her full-hearted support for art of Living activities in Costa Rica.

Guruji was fascinated by the orange fire spewing down the side of the volcano as we drove through the rain forest at midnight. Today the knowledge sheet erupted at the foot of the volcano.

RELIGION AND POLITICS

The role of religion is to make one righteous and loving And politics means caring for people and their welfare. When religion and politics don't coexist then you have corrupt politicians and pseudo-religious leaders.

A religious man who is righteous and loving will definitely care for the welfare of the whole population and hence becomes a true politician. And a true politician can only be righteous and loving. He cannot be anything but religious. All the Avatars and prophets have been caring for people and so were in politics. You can find many examples to this effect.

When religions restrict the freedom to worship and restrict modes of worship they become unsuitable for creating a harmonious society. When religion becomes all encompassing and gives full freedom to pray and worship in any manner -- that religion will bring righteousness and peace in people and will be suitable for any society.

People think politics and religion have to be kept separate because many religions did not give freedom to worship and did not care for all people equally. History has shown that religion has created conflict. But irreligious societies (e.g. communism) have created chaos and corruption.

Today both religion and politics need reform. Religion has to become broader and more spiritual to allow freedom of worship and broader to encompass all the wisdom in the world. And politicians have to become more righteous and spiritual.

LOVE AND RENUNCIATION

Only one who has renounced can truly love. To the degree you have renounced, to that degree you have the ability to love.

Often people think those who renounce cannot love, and those who love cannot renounce. This is because so-called renunciants do not seem to be in love, and so-called lovers are very possessive and are in need.

True love is non-possessive and brings freedom, and renunciation is nothing but freedom. Only in freedom can love fully blossom. When in love you say, "I want nothing, I just want this." Renunciation is, " I don't want anything. I am free." In love there is no other need. Renunciation is having no need. Love and renunciation, although appearing to be opposites, are two sides of the same coin.

McQueen said -- They are the same side of the same coin. (laughter)

Tara asked -- Does this mean the lover renounces his beloved?

Guruji responded -- You renounce the attachment, the possessiveness. Renunciation doesn't diminish love; it enhances it.

Only renunciation can sustain love and joy. Without renunciation love turns into misery, possessiveness, jealousy and anger. Renunciation brings contentment and contentment sustains love. Without renunciation one gets discontented, frustrated, sad, fearful, suspicious, analytical. And the whole soap opera begins. And this is what we find in society , don't we?

The so-called renunciants have run away from life frustrated and disappointed. Real renunciation is born out of knowledge and wisdom, knowledge of life in the background of time and space and in the context of this magnanimous universe.

NEWS FLASH There was such a contrast in Shakti Kutir as Guru Dev created the knowledge sheet this week. Profound wisdom was flowing along with the debate and laughter of devotees. Eventually the discussion went haywire. Belma said, "Guruji, you have the purest intellect. Why do you ask us for our opinion? Then it only gets all messed up." Mikey said, "Those who know will know, and those who don't, won't " Tommy said, "Those who don't get it are free!" Finally roaring with laughter some devotees renounced the knowledge sheet to go to dinner.

Last night, at an electrifying Satsang full of uncontrollable laughter and dance, Guruji gave paradoxical knowledge that enlightenment is a journey from heart to head (Of course the talk wasn't taped).

The Clean Gujarat Project has been launched by the devotees from Gujurat. A Yagna was performed in the Bangalore Ashram to bring peace in Kashmir. Two of our teachers will be going to Belgrade and Kosovo.

CHANGE AND LOVE

There are some who are longing for change. Feeling that everything is stagnant in their lives, they want to change partners, careers, dwellings. And there are some who are scared of change. They feel secure the way they are.

There are some who see the change, but don't acknowledge it, out of fear. There are some who do not notice the change at all. There are some who do not think there is anything to change.

And there are some who realize that everything is changing, yet see there is something that is non-changing. Those who recognize the non-changing amidst the change are the wisest of all.

Question 	
:
Must love as well always change?

Sri Sri	
:
Love is your nature. What is your nature cannot change. But the expression of love changes. Because love is your nature, you cannot but love.
 
The mother has total love for the child, but sometimes she feeds the child, sometimes she is strict with the child. "Come on, sit and write!" Sometimes she slaps the child. She does this out of love, and these are all different modes of love. So the expression of love changes. But love itself does not change, because love is your nature.

NEWS FLASH :

There is nothing new. Everything is the same, meaning everything is changing, everything is re-cycled. Guruji this week has spoken beautifully on the four pillars of knowledge. CBC crews followed Guruji around for two days, and taped a high-energy satsang, complete with wild dancing and Carla's raucous laughter, to be broadcast on national television. Admissions to our schools in India continue to increase. The enrolment in our Bangalore school has grown to more than 700 children. Three more schools have been established in under-developed regions in Northern India.

THANK SUPERFICIALLY

Sri Sri	
:
Which is better, to thank deeply or superficially?
Everyone in unison	
:
Deeply!

Sri Sri	
:
No, superficially. (Everyone is baffled.) Thanking needs a separation. Thanking means there are two. If you are deeply thankful, it means you deeply feel the separation.
 	 	 
Deep within there is no need to thank, because there is one-ness. But superficially you can thank. Thanks are like ripples on the surface of the water.

When you say "Thank you," you complete something. You are finishing a transaction, a relationship, a process. "Thank you" is like "good bye." You can complete all transactions at a surface level, but deeper inside is only one-ness.

Thankfulness always exists in relation to something else. You don't thank for nothing at all, you thank for something. But in this case, something is less than nothing!

At the deepest level, thanking has no meaning. Does one hand thank the other hand? The deeper you go, you see there is no "other" to be thanked.

John	
:
So we should thank superficially and feel deeply?
Sri Sri	
:
Feeling is also superficial. If you think the feeling is the depth, then you have not gone deep. Feeling is deeper than thinking. But feelings change. Whatever is the deepest doesn't change.


So thank superficially, not from the depth. Deep thanks indicate deep separation!

Maybe we should say, "I thank you from the tip of my tongue"! (Laughter.)

SATYAM PARAM DHIMAHI

"Satyam Param Dhimahi --
Truth and the Divinity of the transcendental I uphold in my awareness."

It is the intellect that divides the world, and the same intellect can bring it together by soaking itself in Divinity. When the intellect discusses mundane things, it starts dividing the existence. When the intellect starts discussing Knowledge, Wisdom, Truth, then it starts uniting. It brings forth the transcendental. It re-discovers its true nature, which is non-dual.

Whether you complain, compose a poem, or speak Knowledge, you are a witness to the flow. Suppose someone is complaining or justifying. They are simply saying things spontaneously. In the same way, when you speak knowledge of the Self, or spontaneously compose a poem out loud, there is a flow from the intellect.

Anything can flow from the intellect, and you are a witness to the flow, whether it is garbage or wisdom. And all that you can do is pray to the Divine, "Let Wisdom, Divinity and Truth flow through this intellect."

Exercise -- "Give away your names": Give the same name to all the members of the satsang, for one whole month. The name is up to you. You could choose a name like Chris, Michel or Krishna that could refer to anybody.

Question	
:
What is the purpose of this exercise?
Sri Sri	
:
Your identification with your name is very deep and strong in the consciousness. When you can let go of the name, you experience freedom.

Over 250 Art of Living teachers have gathered at Lake Tahoe for the Teachers' Fiesta, a truly ecstatic celebration and feast of sublime knowledge. The snow-covered peaks of the Sierra Nevada Mountains are not nearly as high as the energy here nor the knowledge that is flowing from the Master. In India, a mass food and clothes distribution for the poor took place at the Bangalore Ashram.

GURU IS THE GOAL

Guru is nothing but wisdom and love.

Guru is that principle which is wisdom and love, and that is awakened in each one who has stepped onto the path. You also call that person a Guru in whom there is no gap between life and wisdom and love.

Often one recognizes wisdom but sees a gap between wisdom and one's own life. The purpose of becoming a disciple is to bridge that gap. Being with the Guru means spontaneous integration of life and wisdom.

 

NEWS FLASH

Miracle in Tahoe: Finally all the diverse personalities in the AOL are saying, "I agree with you." It is the latest buzz word! Agree comes from the Sanskrit word "Agra" which means to be in the forefront.

At the Teacher's Fiesta all rose to a new level of wisdom. One thousand people have assembled for the Guru Purnima Celebration at Lake Tahoe with Vedic chanting and tears of gratitude. Advanced courses and Guru Purnima celebrations happened all over the world.

HOW TO CONQUER JEALOUSY OR ENVY

1.	 	Know that the person that you are jealous or envious of has done some good karma in the past and they are now reaping the fruit.
2.	 	Take it as an inspiration to gain merit now.
3.	 	Create a sense of belongingness with them. See that they are a part of you.
4.	 	Think of all you have that they don't have and feel grateful.
5.	 	Ananda says, "Observe the sensations."
6.	 	Join hands and form a team with them.
7.	 	Realise that in the current of moving time all will perish.
8.	 	Think of everyone that is jealous of you for what you have.
 	Stephano added: "And see that all that people envy you for has not brought joy anyway."
9.	 	Stephano: "Go and ask them 'are you happy?' "
 	Caroline: "And what if they say 'Yes?' " (Laughter!).
 	If the answer is "yes" then they must be in the Art of Living (Laughter!)
 	"What to do if others are jealous or envious of you?"
Ananda	
:
"What to do if others are jealous or envious of you?"

1.	 	Praise them in superlatives.
2.	 	Create a sense of belongingness in them by your kind actions.
3.	 	Know that their feelings are temporary.
4.	 	The best is not to recognise their envy or jealousy at all. If you recognise a feeling as a reality it only makes your ignorance grow.
 
5.	 	Know all feelings and emotions are just like passing clouds.
6.	 	Do not show off your talents to them.
7.	 	Know that they are puppets. They will all perish like apples and tomatoes - just a longer shelf-life (Laughter!).
 
If nothing else works just go to sleep (Shirley: "And don't forget to take a pillow").

Question : With all the talk of the eclipse on the 11th of August what should we do?
The time during an eclipse is an auspicious time for doing spiritual practices. Make sure your stomach is fairly empty. You should stop eating at least a couple of hours before the beginning of an eclipse and you may do your spiritual practices such as meditation, Kriya, Satsangs, etc.

It is advisable that pregnant women and nursing mothers (for the first three months) stay in-doors during the time of an eclipse (3-4 hours).

The AOL and Human Values 5H Program brochure was so nice that the Government of India stole the program word-for-word and made it into their own but we're not jealous about it!

As usual Bad Antogast is filled with celebration.

ANU VRAT

Mind lives on more. Misery starts with "more and more". Misery makes you dense and gross. Self is subtle. To go from gross to subtle you go through the finest relative... the atom. To overcome aversion, hatred, jealousy, attraction or entanglements, you have to go to the atom. Going to the atom means accepting a teeny tiny bit of all this.

It may be difficult to accept something that you don't like but you can definitely accept a teeny tiny bit (an atom) of it. The moment you accept that one atom, you will see change happen. This has to be done in a meditative state.

Suppose you love someone. You want more and more of them. Yet there is no fulfilment. In Anu Vrat (the vow of an atom), you take just one atom of that person and that is enough to bring fulfilment to you.

Though the river is vast, a little sip quenches your thirst. Though Earth has so much food, just a little bite satisfies your hunger. All that you need is teeny tiny bits. Accept a teeny tiny bit of everything in life, that will bring you fulfilment.

Stephano: What about trouble?

There is so much trouble in the world, you can accept just a teeny tiny part of it. Tonight go to bed feeling that you are satisfied, taking a teeny tiny part of divinity with you.

Satisfaction comes from the subtle and not from the "more and more".

Question: What about giving?

You take a teeny tiny part, and the rest you give away.

 

NEWS FLASH

Solar eclipse: For a teeny tiny 2 minutes there was midnight at noon at Bad Antogast.

- Celebration is in full swing with people from 22 countries in Bad Antogast.

- ART Excel teachers became teeny tiny teenagers and felt a big transformation in TTC 1.

- The Delhi chapter inaugurated the "clean India" seva project in Delhi.

- This is the not such a teeny tiny news flash.

KNOWLEDGE AS A BURDEN

Knowledge is a burden if it robs you of innocence.
Knowledge is a burden if it is not integrated into life.
Knowledge is a burden if it doesn't bring joy.
Knowledge is a burden if it gives you an idea that you are wise.
Knowledge is a burden if it doesn't set you free.
Knowledge is a burden if it makes you feel you are special.

 

NEWS FLASH

We are used to all kinds of systems -- financial systems, operational systems, management systems, social systems But we are oblivious to the Cosmic System that has always been prevalent.

Transition from our little systems of functioning to the cosmic system of functioning is what we call Chaos. The little mind blasts into the Cosmic System around Sri Sri, giving out laughter, pain, tears, gratitude and other emotions. All our ashrams run on the cosmic system, and the devotees' homes are also switching to this mode of functioning.

Sri Sri's return to India saw the three-thousand strong crowd at the Bombay satsang, (amazing for a weekday afternoon, with virtually no publicity!) in a frenzy of joyous celebration. From masti in Mumbai, it is now bliss in Bangalore!

Protection and Transformation

Only that which is temporary, small or perishable needs protection, while that which is permanent, big or vast does not.
Your body needs protection, your soul does not.
Your mind needs protection, the Self does not.

Protection simply means prolonging the time. Protection also prevents transformation. Transformation cannot happen in protection.

At the same time, without protection the desired transformation cannot happen. A seed needs protection to transform into a plant, a plant needs protection to become a tree.
Protection can aid or hamper transformation. The protector should have an idea to what extent he should protect.

Kashi says: Grace brings transformation with protection.

Truth does not need any protection. Both protection and transformation come within the purview of time and space and these laws have to be honoured in order to transcend time.

We are both protected and transformed - that is Hari and Hara. Hari - the protector and Hara - the transformer.

Protection is limited to Time, to perishable things. How long can a doctor can heal or protect someone? Forever? No!

Peace and happiness don't need protection because they are not temporary.

Onam was celebrated in the ashram with full Kerala pomp and splendour. The moon blushed and went into hiding after seeing the Divine in all His glory.

A very renowned saint of Ratnagiri temple, who is always dressed in only a loin cloth, observes strict silence, and never moves out anywhere, was eagerly waiting for Sri Sri's visit as ancient scriptures written 5000 years ago had predicted His visit there.

WHO WINS?

Many people quit doing seva as they put their self-image, prestige, respect, comfort and convenience ahead of their goal.

That is how in groups people shy away from seva -- when they don't get a position, when they get insulted, when they feel they are not getting what they expected out of it, and when they consider their goal as a struggle rather than a challenge.

And that is why only few people in the world succeed in reaching their goal.

What is more important to you?

TWO ANECDOTES

Once somebody made a mistake and Guruji asked him, "What punishment can I give you?"

The person replied, "Don't punish me, Guruji, I won't make the mistake again."

After some time Guruji asked another person, "And what punishment can I give you?"

With a bright smile Nityanand replied, "Any punishment, Guruji."

At this Guruji turned to the rest of us with a smile and said, "See, he is so confident of my love for him that he is not afraid of any punishment.

Where there is love, there is no fear.
Do not be afraid of being punished by God.
Trust in the love that He has for you."

It was Arun and Chitra's wedding anniversary. They presented an ornate fan to Guruji, saying, "A fan from two grateful fans."

At this Guruji said, "Devotees are the fan; God is the air. Air is always there, but the fans make you feel it. God is always there; devotees make His presence felt!"

 

And three more miracles

On a domestic flight in the US, Manjesh's mother fainted. A checkup showed that the aorta had dilated; the doctors suggested an immediate operation. She visited Guruji in San Jose, and when she went for a checkup again, the aorta was back to its normal size! The doctors could not believe this miracle.

Mr Sardana from Delhi could not even walk - he was advised a heart transplant and total bed rest. He somehow made it to both the Basic and Advanced Courses, and his doctors were amazed to find his heart absolutely normal! Now he walks happily all over the ashram.

In Deesa, Gujarat, a boy who was deaf-mute since birth, started speaking and hearing after his first Sudarshan Kriya!

Many such experiences are being reported from all over.

Lord Krishna's birthday was celebrated in all gaiety at the Ashram. Young and younger devotees danced and played, transported back five thousand years!

Bangalore city saw its biggest ever satsang this week.

Compassion and Karma

There are two types of compassion. One is the compassion of the wise, one is that of the ignorant.

An ignorant person's compassion is on the fruit of an action whereas a wise person's compassion is towards the non-availability of knowledge. Compassion for suffering shows ignorance. Suffering comes because of karma, and if you believe in karma, where is compassion? One reaps the fruit of one's actions.

If a judge has compassion for all the offenders then the jails will be empty. At the same time, are the judges cruel to the offenders? No; the judges' compassion is for the non-availability of knowledge, not for the suffering of the criminals. It is their karma.

Often people think compassion is an act, an action. Know that compassion is your very nature. Then you will see that karma and compassion are not contradictory but complement each other.

Suppose two people come to a hospital. One is suffering from starvation, the other is ill from overeating. What type of compassion should the doctor have towards each of them? This is a riddle for you to solve!

NEGATIVITY NEEDS AN ANCHOR

Negativity cannot remain without a support.

Positivity, happiness can be without any reason.

The mind goes on trying to find support for its negativity. It looks for a hook to hang its negativity on - if not this person, then that thing or that person and so on.

This perpetuates the maya!

The creeper of negativity needs a support in order to grow. But negativity or aversion for even one person can guarantee a one-way ticket to hell - you need nothing else!

All negativity is a pointer to move to the centre and broaden the vision to the cosmic intelligence.

Instead of focussing your attention on support for your negativity, look at the seed of negativity.

With meditation, silence, kriya, the source of negativity is nipped at the root.

 

NEWS FLASH

Bangalore city saw its biggest and best ever Satsang - nearly two thousand people were actually outside the jam-packed hall, but were smilingly watching the proceedings on a large screen!

The festival of Lord Ganesha is being celebrated with gusto all over India.

A new seva project was inaugurated by Guruji in the village of Urugahalli (which is already adopted by AOL) which saw over 200 girls being given self - employment.

LIFE IS A WAR

Life is a war.
Doctors are fighting against diseases.
Lawyers fight against injustice.
Teachers are fighting against ignorance.

Depression happens when you lose the will to fight. Arjuna was depressed and he did not want to fight. His bow fell from his hands and his fingers trembled. Krishna urged him to wake up and fight! The decision to fight can take away your depression like it did for Arjuna.

Bharat says "Fight till you give up."

SPRITUALITY AND CELEBRATION

Celebration is the nature of the spirit.
Any celebration has to be spiritual.
A celebration without spirituality does not have any depth.
And silence gives the depth to celebration.
Some people think being silent is spirituality.
E.g. Many meditators feel that laughing, singing and dancing are not spiritual.

Some people think only celebration is spirituality.
E.g. In some parts of the world, such as in rural India or Africa, celebration means loud music; there is no silence at all.

Spirituality is a harmonious blend of outer silence and inner celebration ; and also inner silence and other celebration!

NEWS FLASH

His Holiness the Dalai Lama was in Bangalore and met Guruji. He was all praise for the Art of Living programs in building India and the world. He lauded Guruji for his success in reviving the ancient Indian Vedic heritage and presenting it to the world in such an accessible way in a modern context.

At the recent International Youth meet on Human Values organised by the United Nations in Seoul, South Koreo, the Art of Living Foundation played a stellar role, and out of the nearly 1000 NGOs participating, Art of Living was the only workshop to be mentioned in the closing ceremony.

Navratri celebrations at the Ashram were a combination of bubbling joy, deep meditation and profound silence. Among the many saints who graced the occasion were the Shankaracharya, and Swami Swatantranand with his humour-filled discourses on the Bhagvatam. Thanks to the excellent video arrangements, the thousands who came were all able to participate fully in all the celebrations. Next year we plan to go live on the Internet!

SOUND FAITH

Have faith in the sound and move on to have faith in the silence. Have faith in sound when it is pleasant and have faith in the silence when the sound is unpleasant.

When some one says something bad you immediately believe it and the mind becomes more disturbed. Believing in an unpleasant sound creates more turmoil in the mind. In that situation shift your faith to silence.

Have faith in the sound, like the chanting of mantras.

People seem to have more faith in chatting and gossip rather than chanting and knowledge. Have faith in the knowledge and chanting and have faith in silence.

Anecdote:
On the day of the full moon, Sri Sri visited the ancient temple of Kollur where there was an elaborately decorated chariot of the goddess being pulled around the temple. Explaining its significance, Sri Sri said that each one of us is like a chariot carrying the power of God within. We are the real chariot of the Divine. Our body is the chariot and the soul is the deity which is being pulled around the world to purify.

ALWAYS?

How to be happy always?
Forget about always, then you are happy.

      In wanting to be comfortable always, one becomes lazy.
      In wanting perfection always, one become angry.
      In wanting to be rich always, one becomes greedy
When we do not realise that only life is for always, then fear comes.

This projection of the nature of self which is "always", on the temporal which can never be "always", is called Maya.

All ways do not lead you, only one way leads you.
If you remove always from your dictionary then everything is alright
Drop "always" and all will be right - that is intelligence.

HOMAGE TO AMMA

Guruji's mother, our beloved AMMA, left her physical body in a peaceful and meditative state at 1p.m. on Nov. 9th, 1999, in Bangalore, just as Guruji set foot in the holy city of Varanasi, precisely as HE had predicted a few days ago. For those present around GURUJI, it was an amazing experience to feel the depth of love and not an iota of grief ! It was a celebration of knowledge, never before experienced! Even as the news came, Guruji kept meeting people and addressed the big Satsang with the same smile as always.

All her life AMMA served with love, humour and dynamism, extending her motherly love to one and all. She had an unparalleled love for GURUJI and shared a unique relationship with HIM - not only as a son but also as a Mentor. Hundreds of people bid a moving farewell to AMMA, singing JAI JAI RADHA RAMAN. AMMA'S mortal ashes were brought to Delhi and GURUJI accompanied them to HARDWAR and immersed them in the Holy Ganges there. A portion of her ashes were also immersed in the river Cauvery, on whose banks AMMA grew up.

On the 9th of Nov., itself, GURUJI was the chief guest at the consecration of the VISHALAKSHI temple at Varanasi, an invitation that had come two months ago. At this very temple, GURUJI'S grandfather had prayed 70 years ago and was blessed with AMMA. Creation returned to it's source as GURUJI reinstalled the very same ancient deity from whom AMMA got her name, on the very same day that she left for her Heavenly abode.

The Art of Living family is greatly indebted to AMMA and seek her blessings. The Memorial Service will be on the 21st of November and all Chapters are requested to have Satsangs that day. Through this event the Art of Living has shown to the world that not only Life, but Death also can be a celebration !

An example inspires and brings confidence in the application of Knowledge. And the visible sign of it is an undying smile. The Self knows neither sorrow nor death. Yet, in it, flow all the relative events.

It's easy to be detached when you are not in love.

Being in utter love, and yet undisturbed; caring yet not worried; persistent yet not perturbed, are all the obvious signs of the Self shining through !

 

NEWS FLASH

Diwali celebrations saw unbounded joy and GURUJI gave full expression to it with a spellbinding dance! One renowned Swamiji commented, "I am narrating Bhagvatam for decades, but experienced DWAPAR (the age of Krishna) for the first time." This tidal wave continued from the banks of the Ganges at Rishikesh to Varanasi, where more than 4000 swayed in bliss. There is a saying - "Kashi Dhama Marnat Mukti" - dying in Kashi {also known as Varanasi}, you attain salvation.Guruji won over everybody's hearts by commenting that now, even while living in Kashi, people could attain salvation. The Touring Tornado held a hurricane satsang at Delhi and then moved on to Hardwar for the IMMERSION.

Death and Spirituality

Death brings you in touch with the reality of life.

Death creates a vacuum, a void.

Void is the fertile ground for the spirit to manifest.

All talents, invention, creativity springs forth from the void, and creation has a tendency to return to the void.

Bharat says, "All the problems come when you avoid the void." (Laughter)

All the places of worship in all religions are connected with places of burial/cremation, as the awareness of death alone can bring dispassion and make you well grounded in knowledge.

According to the Indian mythology, the abode of Shiva is in Mount Kailasa as well as in Smashana (the cremation ground).

Kailasa means "where there is only celebration", and Smashana is where there is only void.

Thus the Divinity dwells in the void as well as in celebration.

And in you there is void, in you there is celebration.

 

NEWS FLASH

Art Excel children avoided sweets, colas and fireworks this Diwali festival and saved the money to sponsor kids for the tribal school.

In the Rishikesh Advanced course hall there is no void, but only celebration!

Profound knowledge and immense love are radiating from Guruji.

Memorial satsang for Amma has been scheduled for 21st November.

In a devotee's house in Bhubaneshwar, Orissa, Guruji's photograph turned red just before the cyclone and returned to normalcy after the cyclone was over. Some devotees from Orissa actually made it to Rishikesh despite the catastrophic conditions in the state. One lady shared that she was in a meeting with about 50 people, when she felt that Guruji was sending her a message. Closing her eyes, she prayed to Guruji and then immediately advised everyone to evacuate the city. Later it was discovered that the entire area, including that building, was submerged in the deluge. She thanked Guruji with tears of gratitude for saving their lives.

Our volunteers are already engaged in seva and relief work in Orissa.

Aggression as a means to overcome depression

Lack of idealism is the main cause of depression among the youth today. Life appears to be so meaningless to these children, who are either too scared of the competitive world or bogged down by heavy stimuli. They need an inspiration....
And Spirituality is that inspiration that can keep the spirit up!

Aggression is the antidote to depression.
Depression sets in if there is a lack of zeal to fight.

Depression is lack of energy, and anger and aggression are a bolt of energy.
When Arjuna was depressed, Krishna inspired him to fight and thus reinstated life back in Arjuna. If you are depressed, don't take Prozac - just fight - for any cause!

If aggression crosses a certain limit it leads you back into depression. That's what happened with King Ashoka, who won the Kalinga war but became depressed. He had to take refuge in Buddha.

WISE ARE THOSE WHO DO NOT FALL EITHER INTO AGGRESSION OR DEPRESSION.

That's the golden line of a Yogi.
Just wake up and acknowledge you are a Yogi!



 

NEWS FLASH

The two Advanced courses in Rishikesh were simply out of this world. Guruji flew for a day to Bangalore for the memorial service of His most beloved Amma. People had come from from all parts of India to pay homage to the great lady who gave Guruji to this world. Guruji did Aarti to Amma's portrait, singing the same song that Amma used to sing when she did Aarti to Him. Tears flowed from everyone. Guruji shared a few anecdotes about Amma; it is no coincidence that Amma left the body on Yama Dwitiya and the Vaikuntha Samaradhana fell on Vaikuntha Chaturdashi day (the day when Godliness wakes up.)

Then He flew back to Delhi where He addressed a mind-boggling satsang for thousands. Then on to Indore, where huge cutouts and welcome arches greeted Guruji. The indoor stadium was packed to its capacity of 20,000. The following day saw over 40,000 people spellbound in meditation at the open-air stadium. This was telecast live on local TV. Guruji has devised a new way of giving darshan - all the 40000 were satisfied - guess how!

THINK FRESH

To think fresh you need to be free of all the impressions. Let go of all the impressions right this moment and be Hollow and Empty. When you hear a word the sound conveys the meaning instantaneously. Similarly, the knowledge that you are sitting, standing, talking, etc. neither needs a confirmation nor a proof.

Just an intention to be free makes you free right away. Realization that freedom is your very nature, brings enormous Shakti (Energy).

Then on to Cochin in Kerala where an inter-faith convention attended by thousands. The Imam of Trivandrum and the Bishop of Cochin have praised the Art of Living in elevating Human Values. Several senior government officials and dignitaries took part in the program.

A traffic policeman in Cochin suddenly got a glimpse of Guruji and started giving wrong signals ("with a blissful smile on his face", Raghu adds). In the evening, Guruji served dinner for all the volunteers before leaving Kottayam.

THE FIVE SECRETS

There are five secrets which are sacred and are guarded by the subtle beings and angels in this creation. They are:

Jananarahasya (the secret of birth)
Birth is a secret. How a soul takes a body, the criteria for selecting the place of birth, time of birth, type of body, parents, etc are all a secret.

2. Maranarahasya (the secret of death)

Death is a highly guarded secret. Death remains a mystery. The process of separation of spirit from matter and its journey from then on is a secret.

Rajarahasya (the royal secret, the secret of ruling)
The principles of governing; the principles of maintaining the orderliness in creation are a secret.

4. Prakritirahasya (the secret of nature)

Nature is a mystery. The more you know about nature, the mystery deepens. The more a scientist knows, the more he feels there is much more to know. Science, though appearing to resolve the mystery in creation, has deepened it. The knowledge of particles, wave functions, black holes, the vacuum state, etc have only deepened the mystery.

5. Mantrarahasya (secret of mantras)

The mantras and their effect, influence, method and mode of working are all a mystery. Mantras are the impulses or rhythms of consciousness, which itself is a mystery.

Usually in the West, a secret is shameful and dishonest. But in the East, it is honored and regarded as sacred.

Sri Sri's tour of seven cities in Kerala saw thousands of people coming to satsangs, culminating in the grandest ever satsang and meditation of the millennium. Over seventy-five thousand people sat enraptured in meditation for half an hour in pin-drop silence in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala.

Our teachers Nitin Limaye and Bharat Shirur, representing Guruji and the Art of Living, addressed the World Parliament of Religions in Cape Town, South Africa this week.

THE WISDOM OF SECRETS

A wise person makes no effort to conceal a secret. But he does not make an effort to reveal a secret either. For example, you do not talk about menstruation, death, etc. to a five-year-old, but as they grow older these things are not hidden from them any more. They become known as a matter of course.

An unenlightened one tries to protect a secret; and he also reveals the secret at the wrong time, to the wrong person, in the wrong place and makes a big fuss about secrets.

Trying to protect a secret causes anxiety and discomfort.

An ignorant one is not comfortable with a secret, whether revealed or unrevealed, but the wise one is comfortable with a secret whether revealed or unrevealed!

INTENTION

Intentions keep the tension in. Being hollow and empty means dropping all intentions. Within tension, rest does not become deep. Devotion dissolves intentions. Intention pushes you to the future. Bliss is always present. The one who wakes up to this truth is wise. In a state of bliss, once in a while, if an intention comes up, it manifests effortlessly. The more intentions you have, the more in tension you will be. To minimize your intentions could be your last intention.

NEWS FLASH

Guruji's stay in India concluded with a grand celebration with more than seven thousand people from all over Bangalore.

THE NATURE OF THE FIVE SENSES IS KNOWLEDGE

Every cell of your body has the ability of all the five senses. You can see without the eyes. Vision is part of consciousness; that is why in dreams you can see without the eyes.

You can feel without the skin; that is why people without limbs can still feel itching in that part. You can smell without the nose; taste without the tongue.

The 5 senses and thinking ability are all present in consciousness. So each cell of the body has the potential ability to perform all the functions of the senses.

When someone says something; you are all ears . . . you are listening from every cell of your body. There is the expression "looking from a 1000 eyes"; one is all eyes. All cells are made of the same tissue. . . each DNA has the ability of all functions of the body.

Consciousness is inherent in all the cells.

Every sensory stimulus brings knowledge which is the nature of consciousness. Sight brings some knowledge - blue, red, green. Knowingness is the nature of consciousness.

Vikas says	
:
Some people who have lost one of their senses find that the others become heightened.
Guruji replies	
:
You don't have to lose one to sharpen the others. . .you can sharpen all of them in deep silence.
 
Mikey asks	
:
What happens when you have no sense?
Guruji answers	
:
You become like Mikey!! (room explodes with laughter)
New Year's Exercise
Feel that every cell has the potential to see and hear. . . all eyes and ears. Sit comfortably. . . . easily, close the eyes . . . know that you are all eyes, all ears.

Five Factors That Influence the Mind

Place, Time, Food, Past Impressions, and Associations and Actions

The space -the place you are in.
Every place you are in, has a different impact on the mind. Even in your house, you can see that you feel different in different rooms. A place where there there has been singing, chanting and meditation has a different influence on the mind. Suppose you like a particular place; you may find that a little later it will not be the same.

Time is also a factor.
Different times of the day and year have different influences on the mind.

Different types of food that you take influence you for some days.

The past impressions-the Karmas- have a different impact on the mind. Awareness, alertness, knowledge and meditation all help erase the past impressions.

Associations and actions
The people and events you are associated with do influence your mind. Your actions and associations effect your mind. In certain company your mind behaves in one way and with others in a different way.

Question	
:
Should we worry about them?
Answer	
:
No need to be paranoid about it. Just know them!

Though these five factors influence the life and the mind, know that the Self is much more powerful. As you grow in knowledge, you will influence them all.



NEWS FLASH:

1300 people from over 41 countries gathered to celebrate the New Millennium Satsang and Advanced Course at Massa di Carrara, Tuscany, Italy. As the sun set, they gathered on the shore of the Mediterranean with Guruji chanting Om to say goodbye to the passing millennuim. They were uplifted and inspired by a silent mediation at midnight and Satsang with extemporary bhagans in many languages. Satsangs and New Years Advanced Courses were held around the world in over 93 countries to welcome the New Millennium.

On January 6th Guruji spoke on Italian national television as part of the continuing celebration.

The Advanced Course people were so blissed out that the French translator spoke into the Italian earphones for forty minutes and the French had no translation and no one commented!!!

Dog Story:
So there was this man who walked his dog every day for 7 years. On this particular day he goes to walk the dog and the dog misbehaves and runs away from him. The dog runs for about 10 minutes. The man finds him standing under a pole announcing the Milano Satsang. So the man sees him standing there and the dog won't move. This forces him to read the poster. He decides that the dog ran all over because the dog wanted the man to see the poster. The man called his friends and told them to come to the Satsang.
The dog lead the men to the Divine.

Being with the Guru

People have various reasons to be with a Guru.

Broadly they can be put in these 5 catagories.

You would like to have your wishes fulfilled and because it is more pleasurable.
Everything else looks more painful to you and you come for comfort.
You want to evolve and become enlightened; you want to know higher Knowledge.
You have a vision or goal; you share a vision of the Guru. Missionary or visionary.
You are there to just serve and give comfort to the Guru.
You are with the Guru because you belong to the Guru. There is no choice.

EVOLUTION: NOT PART OF THE SELF

Are you evolving? If you are evolving, you are not in the Self. And you are not out of the Self, because nothing can exist out of the Self. (Laughter)

Broadly they can be put in these 5 catagories.

There are six distortions that do not exist in the Self.

Expansion -- Prasarana. Expansion indicates there is already something into which something expands. That which expands cannot be the basis for expansion.
Contraction -- Akunchana. Contraction means something shrinks from something else. Self does not withdraw or shrink from anything, so contraction does not exist in the Self.
Evolution -- Vriddhi. Evolution is becoming something which it is not already. Self is the same, so it cannot evolve.
Decay -- Kshaya. There is no devolution or decay in the Self. It doesn't get old or stale. That's why, when you are close to your Self, you don't feel that you are aging.
Beginning -- Anaadi. Self has no beginning. If God has a beginning, then He is no God.
Lack -- Abhava. Self has no lack. Whatever lacks something is not complete. Self does not lack anything, it is complete. Lack indicates existence of something outside itself. That doesn't exist for the Self. So if you feel you have not grown at all, don't worry, you are close to the Self. (Laughter)
When your mind is with the Self, then you don't worry about evolution. If you are thinking about evolving, then you are stuck in the mind. And mind is part of the matter, and matter evolves and decays.

And that is how the experience of contraction and expansion is all play and display of the mind. Mind expands and contracts. When it expands, it comes close to the truth, which has no expansion.

Are you still evolving? Good luck!!

VARIETIES OF SPIRIT

Why should you think God is only one? Why can't He also be many? If He has made man in His own image, what image is He? An African, a Mongolian, a Caucasian, a Japanese, a Filipino? Why are there so many types of man, and so many varieties of things?

There is not just one type of tree, not just one type of snake, cloud, mosquito or vegetable - there is not just one type of anything, so why should God be only one? How could this consciousness that manifested this whole creation and loves variety, be monotonous? God seems to love different varieties. He must be of infinite variety Himself. God can manifest in many names, forms and varieties.

Some schools of thought may not give God the freedom to appear in His many forms. They want Him in one uniform!

You change your appearance to suit the occasion. When such is the case, how could you think there is no variety in the Spirit. The ancient people knew this and that's why they cognized the Divinity as infinite qualities and forms. The Spirit is not dull and boring. The Spirit which is the basis of creation is dynamic and ever changing. God is not only one, but is many!!!

When you accept the variety of Divinity you cease to be a fanatic or a fundamentalist.

Tommy says God is many, God is One, he made so many just for fun.

PROBLEM

Guruji says: There is no problem that cannot be solved!!!

Someone says: I have a few I can give you. (Laughter)

Guruji says: When you have a problem and you think it cannot be solved, then you have accepted it then it is no longer a problem; it is a fact.

For example: Suppose you think it is a problem that the ocean in Norway is too cold. Obviously, you cannot heat the ocean. If it cannot be solved, you accept it and it's no longer a problem. Only when you are searching for a solution is there a problem and so there is no problem that cannot be solved. (Laughter)

The moment you realize there is no solution, a problem ceases to be a problem.

The solution is the tail of every problem.

Solutions come to you when :
     You are calm and collected
     You use intelligence
     You are not lethargic but active
     You have strong faith in Divine law

Kai says: If you don't want any problems, you can have a Guru.

Sheila says: If you want all the problems of all the people, become a Guru.

Tom says: Focusing on the problem alone, you cannot solve it. But, when you go step up to your real need, your real goal, to the higher Self, you find many solutions.

Worship

Do not worship or idolize worship. Idolizing without a sense of  belongingness is always futile.  Such worship only causes fear and distance.  And there are others who are  paranoid about  worship. They get irritated by seeing others worshipping. The modes of worship or idolizing may be different in different parts of the world. Some worship the pope ; others worship the pop stars.  Some are crazy about the politicians. Look at all the children. They  worship  their heroes  all  over  the walls.  Just adoration makes you a fan. Having a sense of belongingness and seeing the Divinity in those whom you adore, makes you a saint.

 

Raghu: You mean we can see Divinity in a pop star or politician.

Guruji: If You can;..A Divinity that is distorted ( laughter) Those who worship without a sense of belongingness and those who are against worship are in  the same boat  as both are clogged with fear.  In  the  Bible, it says, " I am your God. And  you shall have no other before  me. "  The same is said in the ancient Indian scriptures. "One who worships God as separate from the "I am" consciousness is dull headed". And  " Poojo aur na deva".Do not worship other Gods. The offering, the offered and the offerer are all ONE.

FEEL THE PINCH

A devotee asked Guruji: Please forgive me if I have committed a mistake.

Sri Sri: Why should you be forgiven? You are asking for forgiveness because you feel a pinch and you want to be free from it, isn't it? Let the pinch be there. The pinch will not let the mistake happen again. Forgiveness removes the pinch and you keep repeating the mistake!

Question: How do you know a mistake is a mistake?

Sri Sri: A mistake is something that gives you a pinch. If it hasn't pinched you, it is not a mistake at all.

It is the pinch that irks the consciousness and that pinch disallows the mistake to be repeated. Be with the pinch and not the guilt. It is a very fine balance.

Question: What is the difference between guilt and pinch?

Sri Sri: Guilt is about a specific action and pinch is about a specific result or happening. You can only feel guilty about what you did and not about what happened. But whatever happened, whether because of you or someone else can cause a pinch in you.

Question: How do we get over the guilt?

Tom Gill: Just blame the boss!!! ( laughter)

Sri Sri: Through wisdom, by knowing the nature of mind, nature of consciousness and from a broader perspective of the phenomenon, you can get over the guilt.

Question: Cant we learn from our mistakes without feeling the pinch?

Sri Sri: Learning is at an intellectual level whereas you feel the pinch at an emotional level. The drive of your emotions is much stronger than your intellect. So a pinch will not let the mistake recur.

Bharat: We feel guilt where we have control, it is at the intellectual level, whereas a pinch is at the emotional level where we do not have control.

Question: So, should we discard the intellect?

Sri Sri: You cannot be driven by your emotions alone. Your intellect acts like a brake for your emotions!

Feel the pinch.

The pinch will create an awareness that what happened was beyond your capacity.

The awareness will bring you to surrender.

Surrender will free you from guilt.

So, from pinch to awareness to surrender to freedom are the steps of evolution.

SKILL IN PRAISING

Often, when you praise, you praise in comparison to someone else. In order to praise one person, we put down someone else and when we want to point out somebody's mistake we praise another.

Some are stingy in praising, and some are shy.

And some others are simply not used to.

Some praise with motives, and some others just to elevate.

Others praise themselves in order to hide their low self-esteem.

The real praise dawns in a blossomed state of consciousness.

The praise that comes out of an elevated state of consciousness is simply its nature and is quite different. Normally praise comes out of craving and pride. The praise from a heightened consciousness is always out of fulfilment.

Praising can no doubt elevate the consciousness and bring enthusiasm and energy. At the same time it can also bring arrogance. Praising is a skill.

When someone praises you, do you take it without shying away?

Accepting praise without shyness, is also a skill.

NEWS FLOOD

This week we had so much newsthat we are sending just the news flood!

It has been an unusually hectic week even by Sri Sri's standards. Last Friday, Sri Sri addressed three satsangs in a single day, starting with the rural satsang among thousands of poor people of Inchilla, a brief stopover with the enthusiastic devotees of Belgaum, and on to the urban elite of Goa, with the sound of our bhajans reverberating everywhere.

Ahmedabad was all keyed up as Sri Sri returned after a two-year gap.Teachers from all over Gujarat had been working together to make this the biggest satsang ever. In the morning, over 25, 000 people did the Sudarshan Kriya conducted "live" by Sri Sri...Intense experiences, strong fragrances, changes in the weather pattern were happening as three eagles circled directly overhead, joined by a flock of other birds Ö a cosmic rhythm was set in motion. Many people shared that their entire life was one side and this event on the other, such was the magnitude of the experience for them. Kriya was followed by an elaborate lunch for the participants the network of volunteers had organised 60 counters to feed all of them!

In the evening, the same cricket stadium was transformed, with a huge lotus designed up in the stands for Guruji to sit in, and video screens all over the grounds. It was a sight to see streams of people flooding in, all excited and happy even before the program began, the crowd totalled nearly 200,000! The traffic diversion for the event was announced by the traffic police well in advance, as THE event took off without any chaos.

Following 27 minutes of total, still meditation, the entire crowd were on their feet, singing and dancing Ö the sub-inspector of police remarked that even though a meagre force of 500 was deployed, they had nothing to do, so blissful and orderly was the crowd. The policemen would hug people, and confessed that only their uniform was preventing them from joining the dance. The high priests of the ancient city of Dwarka (Krishna's capital), came all the way to invite Guruji, and placed a resplendent turban (which was from the temple deity) on His head.

The next day was the foundation-laying ceremony of the Gujarat ashram on the banks of the river Mahi. After a brief satsang in Vidyanagar, Guruji addressed over 3,000 Art Excel kids Ö it was the best ever question-and-answer session, with witty one-line exchanges between the little ones and the Wise One.

Enthusiastic devotees with a live band awaited Guruji at 4 am in Jamnagar. Guruji visited the ancient capital of Krishna in Dwarka for a Vishnu Yagna in the ancient Dwarkadheesh Temple. The entire city danced as Guruji was taken in a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Dwarka's  it was a non-stop celebration.

That evening, we had another Divine Satsang in Jamnagar, before returning to Ahmedabad. The blissful ones are now in Delhi, en route to Rishikesh.

PS: The three-year-old daughter of one of our devotees fell from a three-story building recently. She told her parents later that "That bearded uncle whose photo we have at home He caught me!" She escaped totally unhurt. (Caution: Please don't try this at home!!)

FORM AND FORMLESS, AND AGGRESSION AND INTUITION

A: Form and Formless

Life is a combination of form and formless.

Feelings have no form but their expressions have form.

The Self has no form but its abode has form.

Similarly, wisdom and grace have no form but are expressed through form.

Discarding the formless, you become inert, materialistic and paranoid.

Discarding the form, you become a lost ascetic, a space cadet or an emotional junk!

B: Aggression and Intuition

Aggression and assertiveness overshadow intuition.

Often, people who are sensitive tend to become aggressive in order to avoid being hurt.

In this process, they lose sight of the fine intuition.

Fine intuition needs sensitivity; sensitivity is often painful.

In order to avoid pain one becomes aggressive and assertive, and in turn loses one's intuitive ability.

Intuition is close to the truth.

To be truthful, you don't need to be aggressive and assertive!

Often, aggression and assertiveness thrive on the idea of truthfulness.

THE GOAL OF ALL ANSWERS

Some questions can be answered only in Silence. Silence is the goal of all answers. If an answer does not silence the mind it is "no" answer.

Thoughts are not the goal in themselves. Their goal is Silence. When you ask the question "Who am I?" you get no answer, there is silence. That is the real answer. For your soul is solidified silence. This solidified silence is wisdom, is knowledge.

The easy way to silence the thoughts is to arouse the feelings. For through feelings only peace, joy and love dawn. And they are all your very nature.

To the question "Who am I?" the only relevant answer is silence. You need to discard all answers in words, including "I am Nothing" or "I am the Cosmic Self" or "I am the Self" - and just stick to the question "Who am I?". All other answers are just thoughts. Thoughts can never be complete. Only Silence is complete.

**Quotes**

"You cannot betray somebody, unless you gain trust. A wicked person first gains trust and then betrays. Even the deception of a wise man will only do the highest good."

"To be afraid of the wicked, is a sign of bad regime and to be afraid to do bad is a sign of good regime."

SURRENDER

The main impediment of many seekers in the path is that they want to surrender. Don't say that you want to surrender; know that you already are surrendered.

Wanting to surrender becomes an impediment on the path. This is like a child saying to the mother, " I want to love you." No child ever tells the mother," I

want to love you", love is evident there.

Surrender is not an act, it is a state of your being. Whether you acknowledge it or not, it is there. The wise wake up and see, the unwise take a longer time.

Know that you have no choice, you are in a state of surrender deep within you.

 

**Anecdotes **

A four year old child, in an Art Excel meeting, told Sri Sri, " I love you very much." Sri Sri asked, " Why?" She replied, "Because God has sneaked into your

heart, and you are in God's heart."

In Satsang, a man asked Sri Sri, " I do not feel the need for a Guru. What is your opinion of people like me?" Sri Sri replied, with a twinkle in his eye, "Don't take my advice!" ( LaughterÅ©

(If the person literally does not take the advice, he has done what the Master said, and thus has anyway become a disciple! If the person takes the advice of

not taking His advice even then he has become a follower! It is a Catch 22 situation!)

HOW TO HANDLE FEVERISHNESS

When you're in the grip of feverishness about the result of your actions, what do you do?

Faith: Have faith and confidence that the result will be much better than you can ever imagine. With faith you can get rid of feverishness of action/achievement.

Feverishness can also be a hangover from overactivity. Then sleep, listening to flute music, cold water baths, etc. can help.

Dispassion: Know the whole thing will be over one way or the other, and it doesn't matter. Meditation and breathing can calm you down. Drop whatever you are doing and do something completely irrelevant, e.g. while decorating your

house, take a moment off to cut grass, or go shopping! When you are doing something very important, take a moment off to do something totally irrelevant and insignificant. This enhances your creativity. Relevant action keeps you bound to the action. Irrelevant action makes life a game!

HOW DOES A DESIRE ARISE?

1. A desire arises with the memory of a pleasant experience and past impressions.

2. A desire might arise through listening.

3. A desire can be triggered through the association of certain people and a place.

4. Someone else's need or desire may manifest in you as your own desire, e.g. when someone is hungry, you get a desire to feed them or someone wants to talk to you and you get a desire to talk to them.

5. The destiny or a happening in which you have a part to play may trigger a desire of which you have no idea. For example, a gentleman in Quebec, Canada kept making roads and working on a farm for 30 years, not knowing for what -- for it was destined to become our Canadian Ashram.

RAM NAVAMI

"Ra" in Sanskrit means "That which is Radiant" and "Ma" stands for "Myself".

That which shines forth within me, is Rama.

That which is radiant in every particle of the Being is Rama.

Rama is born to Dasharatha and Kaushalya. Dasharatha (In Sanskrit this means "the ten charioted one") signifies the five organs of sense and the five organs of action. Kaushalya (Sanskrit for "skilled") stands for skill. The skillful reiner of the ten chariots can give birth to Ram. When the ten are used skillfully, radiance is born within.

Rama was born in Ayodhya (Sanskrit for "the place where no war can happen"). When there is no conflict in our mind, then the radiance can dawn.

Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, was born of Sumitra Ö the good friend. When the ten are cooperating with you then Awareness is born.

Often we try to look for radiance within. Just realize that you are radiant. Once when Guruji was 5 or 6 years old, he closed his eyes and asked a visiting saint, "Swamiji, I do not see any light". The saint replied, "You are the light! How can you see the light?"

A DESIRE KILLS JOY

AND ALL DESIRES AIM FOR JOY@

This couplet needs to be pondered over and over; for a whole lifetime is not sufficient enough to digest this knowledge.

Whenever happiness has disappeared from your life, look deeper and you will see it is because of the desire. And all that we desire is happiness!

No person, animal or creature desiring unhappiness is ever born, never has it happened before and never will it happen in the future.

When your small mind gets tired of running here and there, of wandering everywhere, it reaches a conclusion, "My desires have killed my happiness".

Thus a person who has conquered his desires in called "mahavira".

NEWS FLASH

Guruji had a satsang in Wayanad with over 12,000 people. Later He gave an address in the Catholic Church on Easter Sunday.

YOU ARE NOTHING!

Each experience completes. Completion means leading to void or nothing. In the progression of life, you will leave behind every experience saying, "This is nothing." Anything that is completed loses its importance. That is to say it leads you to void - this is nothing.

A sign of intelligence is how soon you arrive at this understanding. Examine everything in life and say "This is nothing" and what remains after all that is Love, and that is everything.

When "This is nothing" does not come out of knowledge, it comes out of misery. Either through knowledge or through misery, you come to the point of "This is nothing, this is nothing". The choice is yours.

If you got this, it is really NOTHING, If you didn't get this, never mind - this is nothing. (laughter)

Guruji addressed the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) Annual meeting in New Delhi, and was well received.

Guruji visited Ulaan Bataar, capital of Mongolia, on a two-day state visit and was received by the first President of the Mongolian Republic and a few members of parliament. Though the flight was delayed by five hours, thousands waited at the National Opera House, where Guruji was driven straight from the airport. Even though he had traveled such a long distance, there was not a trace of tiredness as he greeted the cheering crowd. Guruji tricked the security guards several times and mingled with the crowd.

Meetings and satsangs at Ulaan Bataar were filled with gratitude. A 10 year old boy who was deaf for several years regained his hearing! A lady who had suffered a paralytic attack felt sensations all through her body on seeing Guruji's picture in the newspapers. Three days later, with some help she came walking to attend Guruji's satsang!!!

On April 29th, Guruji was received by Mongolia's highest Buddhist leader, His Holiness The Hamba Lama Choijamts at the Gandan monastery. The Lama, in his welcome address, noted that Guruji's work has brought so much peace and strength to the people of Mongolia.

DESIRE FOR TRUTH

Buddha said that desire is the cause of all misery. If your desire does not get fulfilled, it leads to frustration and causes misery. Even if it does get fulfilled, it leaves you empty.

Vasishta said that desire is the cause of pleasure. You get pleasure from an object or a person only when you desire them. When you do not desire an object, you do not get pleasure from it. For example, when a person is hot and thirsty, a sip of cold water gives him pleasure; but not if he is not thirsty. Whatever gives you pleasure binds you and bondage is misery.

Sri Sri says when you desire for truth, all other desires drop off. You always desire for something that is not there. But, truth is always there! Desire for truth removes all other desires and it itself dissolves. And what remains is bliss.

NEWS FLASH

TTC I and TTC II ended on a celebrative note and with that began Guruji's South Asian tour. A well attended live Kriya, followed by a Satsang in a packed auditorium the next day highlighted the Singapore visit.

A lady reporter asked Guruji how many followers he has pointing to the people sitting in from of him; he replied, "I don't have any followers; they are all in front of me and I won't turn my back on anyone".

An Art of Living group presented the scientific research on mental health benefits of Sudarshan Kriya to the United Nation's Non-Governmental Organization Mental Health Committee. It was so well received that the discussion was extended an extra hour.

SEEKERS BEWARE

You can only seek that which you know and when you really know, you already have it.

  You cannot seek something which you do not know.

And what ever you are seeking and where ever you seek itÒ³ always only One; and the One is what you already are.

And so -- you cannot seek something you do not know and when you know what you are seeking, you already have it.

When you seek the world, you get misery and when you want to find the way out of misery, you find the divine.

A man lost a penny and was seeking for the penny in a bush when he found a huge treasure. He was not seeking treasure but for his lost penny. In the same way, when you seek for something, you may get something else.

The Truth, Self cannot be sought directly.

Dean says: Many people come to the Art of Living seeking some mundane thing and find something else . . . (laughter)

Is Guru responsible for your enlightenment?

If yes and you don't get awakened, then Guru is to be blamed.

And if you get freedom then also the Guru is to be blamed because he has

been partial to you.

If Guru could set you free, he could have done it to the whole world.

So Guru is not responsible for your awakening.

And yet freedom is next to impossible without Guru.

EDUCATION

Education has five aspects

1. Information -- Often we think information is education, but it is only one aspect of education.

2. Concepts -- Concepts are the basis for all research. You need to conceive in order to create.

3. Attitude -- An integral aspect of education is cultivating the right attitude. Proper attitude at the right time and place determines your actions and behavior.

4. Imagination -- Imagination is essential for creativity, for the arts. But if you get stuck in imagination, you may become psychotic.

5. Freedom -- Freedom is your very nature. Only with freedom, do joy, generosity and other human values blossom. Without freedom, attitudes become stifling, concepts become a burden, information is of no value and imagination becomes stagnant.

TRUTH

Truth is that which does not change. Examine your life and identify all that changes as not truth. With this outlook, you will find that you are surrounded by only untruth.

When you identify that which appears to you as untruth, then you will become free from it. When you don't identify the untruth, you cannot become free from it. Your own experiences in life make you identify your own untruth. As you mature in life, you find everything is untruth - events, situations, people, emotions, thoughts, opinions, concepts, your body - everything is untruth. It is only then the satsang (company of truth) in the real sense happens.

For example, a mother cannot see the child as untruth until the child becomes an adult. For a baby sweet is not untruth, and for a teenager sex is not untruth.

Question: Is Knowledge also untruth?

Sri Sri: Yes, if it is words, it is untruth. But as existence it is truth. Love as an emotion is not truth, as existence it is truth.

HOW TO DEAL WITH HUMILIATION?

Know that humiliation does not weaken you -- it strengthens you.

When you have a sense of belongingness, you don't feel humiliated. The more egotistic you are, the more humiliation you feel. When you are childlike and have a greater sense of kinship then you don't feel humiliated.

When you are committed to truth and not to your ego then you also don't feel humiliated.

If you are afraid of humiliation, you can neither make progress in your material life nor in your spiritual life. When you stand above humiliation, you get closer to the Self - to God. When you are steeped in love, with the Existence, with the Divine, nothing whatsoever can humiliate you.

So, the way out of humiliation is:

Get humiliated!

Be childlike

Be crazy

Get steeped in love with the Divine

Total commitment to Truth-Knowledge

ARGUMENTS AND WRONG ACTION

 

A person who argues should not be given knowledge. An argumentative mind is not receptive to knowledge. When someone is in an argumentative mood, then giving knowledge or advice is in vain. In an argumentative mood you feel you know it all. Then you are not ready for knowledge. That is why wise people do not give advice when they are in an argumentative environment.

Argument has a purpose. It can bring out the truth if there is no emotion or sense of "I" attached to it. Argument can also have a disadvantage. It can make untruth appear to be truth.

A wise man will not take arguments seriously; he will just have fun with them. Wisdom is beyond all arguments.

*****

Both a worldly person and a spiritual person will tell you not to do wrong, though the reasons they give are totally different. A worldly person will tell you not to do wrong because it hurts or causes him pain. A spiritual person will tell you not to do wrong because it would only harm you more.

VIRTUES

Virtues cannot be cultivated. You have to assume that they are there.

In the Gita, Krishna said to Arjuna, "Grieve not Arjuna, you are born with virtues."

The seeker should remember that he is born with virtues; otherwise he could not have been a seeker.

If you think you do not have virtues and then try to cultivate them, you will fail.

You often compare yourself with others on the basis of virtues. Do not compare yourself with them. Simply recognize all the virtues you appreciate in others, and realize that they are already present in you in seed form. You only have to nurture them.

When you think you do not have a virtue, then you come from a space of lack or deficiency.

Caroline: Aho! That is why we don't need positive affirmations!

Alice: Affirmations really don't work anyway.

Sri Sri: Affirmations do not work because you think you do not have those virtues, and with affirmation you try to have them.

And so Caroline affirms: You are the home of all virtues. (laughter)

ACTION AND REACTION

Action is out of conscious decision. Reaction is out of impulsiveness.

Impulsiveness creates a chain of Karma.

Reaction, as well as non-action, both create karma, but a conscious action transcends karma. Conscious action does not create new karma whereas

non-action can create karma.

For example, a soldier shooting in war does not create a karma; a policeman using tear gas does not create a Karma, and if you are a doctor and you do not give medicine to a patient in need, you are incurring a karma.

Through knowledge and devotion, transcend all karmas and be free!

TECHNOLOGY

The purpose of technology is to harness nature to bring information and comfort to human beings. When spiritual values - human values - are ignored and

neglected, instead of bringing comfort, technology brings fear and destruction.

Technology without human values would see nature as a dead object. Science gives an insight into the life of nature and spirituality makes the nature come alive.

For example, in the eyes of children, there is nothing dead in the world - animals, trees, the sun and the moon - they all have life, they all have emotions, they all have feelingsÅ‰n the eyes of a stressed and ignorant person, even human beings are like robots - objects!

Technology without spirituality is destructive. Spirituality is the technology of consciousness, and the whole world is the play and display of consciousness.

CONFLICT AND INNOCENCE

Fights can only happen among equals. When you fight with someone, you make them equal. But in reality there is no one at par with you. When you keep people either above or below you, then there is no fight.

When they are above you, you respect them.

When they are below you, you love them and you feel compassionate.

Either submission or compassion can take you out of a fight in no time. This is one way to look at it when you are tired of fighting. When you are well rested, just fight and have fun.

The same is true of the mind. As long as the mind thinks it is equal to the senses, there is conflict. When it realizes that it is bigger than the senses, there is no conflict. And when the mind is smaller than the senses, like in animals, there is no conflict. When the mind is caught up in the senses, there is constant conflict. When it transcends the senses, it comes back to its true nature, which is innocence - in no sense.

Does this make sense? (Laughter)

DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE BY POINTING OUT MISTAKES!

A lady came to Guruji and said that her husband lied to her. She was very upset. Guruji asked "Why does your husband lie to you? Because he loves you, and is afraid to lose your love or hurt you. If he did not love you, he wouldn't lie to you!"

Do not tell a person a mistake he knows. What's the use of pointing out a mistake that he knows he has committed? By doing this, you will only make them feel more guilty, defensive or resentful and this will only create more distance.

You should only point out the mistake of a person who does not know, but who wants to

know. Do not point out the mistake of a person who knows but doesn't want you to know. Often people know the mistakes that they have committed, but they do not want you to tell them.

Think of the usefulness of your comments. Before pointing out the mistake of a person, see whether your comments in any way will help to improve the situation, foster love or bring harmony. A magnanimous person would not pick on the mistakes of others and make them feel guilty. However, they would correct them with compassion and care, not through words but through attitudes.

DO YOU HAVE TO BE THANKFUL AND FEEL OBLIGED?

When you are on a spiritual path, you are not thankful or obliged to anybody. In the Gita, Krishna says, "He is dear to Me who neither goes on thanking people nor hates anyone (Na abhinandati na dveshthi)."

Thanking and feeling obliged indicates that you believe in some one else's existence rather than in the Divine who is ruling everything. When you feel obliged, then you are not honoring the principles of karma or the divine plan.

Appreciate people for what they are, do not thank them for what they do. Otherwise your thankfulness is centered around ego. You are grateful, but not for an act. You are grateful for what is. As every individual is nothing but a puppet of the ONE, thanking and being obliged is simply an exhibition of ignorance. Everything is ruled, controlled and managed by one Divinity, that consciousness has to shine forth in every act of yours; you do not have to make a mood of it.

Q: Guruji, we are so grateful to you, what should we do?

Sri Sri: When you have a total sense of belonging, then gratefulness does not become an obligation. Such gratefulness is for the Divine only, which enhances strength.

NEWS FLASH Guruji addressed members of the Indian Association at Staten Island, N.Y. along with the Prime Minister of India. He also graced the Ayurvedic

Conference and enlivened the discussion by giving a spiritual dimension to Ayurveda which was otherwise hidden.

Many solutions for the tourism industry emerged when Sri Sri delivered his wisdom at the Confederation of Indian Industry at Agra. At dawn, the minarets of the Taj Mahal seemed to bow in reverence welcoming Sri Sri and his entourage. In spite of Guruji's repeated instruction to look at the Taj Mahal, the devotees' attention remained focused on Sri Sri!

DIVINE LOVE AND THE COMPLAINING FACE

How would you like to see yourself happy and bubbling with enthusiasm or dull and difficult to please?

Often you like to be pleased, appeased and cajoled. So you put up a tough, upset face and act difficult to please. If a person has to appease and please ten people all the time, it will be so tiring. People who keep a long face and expect others to cajole and appease them make others run away. Lovers often do this. They expend a lot of energy in cajoling and this brings down the joy and celebration of the moment.

It is okay for you to show your upset mood or tendency once in a while, but doing it over and over again is taxing for you and people you love.

If you feel down, appease and please yourself. Your need to be appeased by someone else is the sign of grossness. This is the root of ignorance. If you want attention, all you get is tension.

Become one whose enthusiasm never dies, come what may.

It is not possible to attain Divine Love with a complaining face. The complaining face is a sign of an unaware mind. If you want to complain, complain to God or your Guru because both have their ears covered. (Laughter)

NEWS FLASH From a village near Alwar in Rajasthan, a nine year old girl, Uma, who was dumb from birth started speaking after her ART Excel Course. The same was reported of a twelve year old boy from Vallabh Vidyanagar in Gujarat.

Talakatora Stadium in Delhi was aptly decorated for a grand Satsang. Thousands who could not enter the stadium could still fully participate thanks to the big screens provided by the organizers. Guruji went to Rishikesh to inspire and to get inspired by the 108 youth leaders who were going to take up the 5H Program.

DEVOTEE BECOMES GOD

When a river meets the ocean, the river no longer remains a river. It becomes the ocean. A drop of the ocean is part of the ocean. In the same way, the moment a devotee meets (surrenders to) the Divine, the devotee becomes GOD. When the river meets the ocean, it recognizes that it is the ocean from the beginning to the end. Similarly, the individual "IÅ® IÅ®" dissolves in ONE Divinity.

Question: What about backwaters?

Sri Sri: Sometimes the ocean goes into the river to greet it. Sometimes it seems that the ocean is pushing back the river. Similarly, the Divine puts many questions and doubts in the mind or gives an amazing experience to bring one back home.

STEEPED IN MYSTERY IS DEVOTION

One who is not amazed by the magnificence of this Creation, his eyes are not yet opened. Once your eyes are open, they close and this is called meditation. (Laughter)

Tell me, what in this Creation? Is not a mystery?

Birth is a mystery; death is a mystery.

If both birth and death are mysterious, then life is certainly a greater mystery. Isn't it?

Being completely immersed in the mystery of Life and this Creation is Samadhi.

Your knowing or believing doesn't really matter to what Is.

This Creation is an unfathomable secret, and its mysteries only deepen.

Getting steeped in mystery is Devotion.

The "Scene" is a mystery; the "Seer" is a mystery.

Deepening the mystery of Creation is science.

Deepening the mystery of the Self is spirituality.

They are the two sides of the same coin.

If neither Science nor Spirituality can create wonder and devotion in you, then you are in deep slumber.

Knowledge Tidbits:

When a materialistic person tells you a secret, it will only create doubts and spread malaise.

When a wise or spiritual person tells you a secret, it will uplift your consciousness and spread benevolence.

PERFECTION IS THE NATURE OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONE

In a state of ignorance, imperfection is natural and perfection is an effort.

In a state of wisdom or enlightenment, imperfection is an effort; perfection is a compulsion and is unavoidable!

Perfection is taking total responsibility, and total responsibility means knowing that you are the only responsible person in the whole world. When you think that others are responsible, then your degree of responsibility diminishes.

When you are in total Vairagya (dispassion), you can take care of even trivial and insignificant things with such perfection. For example, during the Pooja every morning, Guruji decorates the Pooja table with flowers with such great care, choosing different color combinations and patterns everyday; fully knowing that the decoration is not going to last even 10 minutes. After the Pooja He himself would remove the garlands from the Pooja table or shower people with the flowers on it. Yet even while He is in a deep state of Samadhi, He would effortlessly and lovingly decorate the Pooja table everyday. It is obvious that it does not matter how the flowers are kept, but still attention to even such a trivial thing with such keenness of awareness can only come through utter dispassion.

Perfection is the very nature of the Enlightened one.

LOVE IS THE SHADOW OF THE SELF

When you love something, you have a sense of belongingness with it. You can only love something, because it is belongs to you. If it is not yours, you cannot love it. Love is the shadow of the Self.

The bigger the Self, the bigger the shadow, and the bigger the love.

When the love is cast over the entire creation, then you are the Big Self. That is the Lordship.

When the Lordship dawns on the Self, there is perennial celebration.

*****

Deepawali happens.

Today is Deepawali, the festival of lights. There are many stories associated with this day.

It was this day that the demon Narakasaura was killed. King Narakasura (Naraka means hell) had been granted a boon that he could be destroyed only by a woman. Lord KrishnaÒ³ wife Satyabhama was the one to destroy him.

Why only Satyabhama could kill Naraka? Satya means truth and bhama means the beloved. Untruth or lack of love cannot conquer hell.  It cannot be removed by aggression. Hell can only be erased by love and surrender. Non-aggression, love and surrender are the inherent qualities of a woman. Hence only Satyabhama, the true beloved could remove hell and bring the light back. And NarakasuraÒ³ last wish was that every house should celebrate his exit with lights to mark the end of darkness. This is Deepawali.

Also it was today that Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya, his Kingdom, after his victory over Ravana, the demon king. Ayodhya means that which cannot be destroyed, i.e. life. Ram means the Atma (the Self). When Self rules in life, then knowledge lights up. There is life everywhere. But when the spirit is awakened in life, deepawali happens.

ARE YOU A TOURIST OR A PILGRIM?

What is the difference between a tourist and a pilgrim?

Both are on a journey.  Whereas a tourist is satisfying the senses, a pilgrim is in the quest of the truth. A tourist gets tired and tanned, while a pilgrim sparkles with spirit. Every move a pilgrim makes is with sacredness and gratitude, while a tourist is often preoccupied and unaware.

A tourist compares with other experiences and places and hence is not in the present moment. But a pilgrim has a sense of sacredness, so he tends to be in the present moment.

Most people in life are just tourists without even being aware of it. Only a few make their life a pilgrimage. Tourists come, look around, take pictures in their mind, only to come back again. Pilgrims are at home everywhere and are hollow and empty. 

When you consider life as sacred, nature waits on you.

Are you a tourist or a pilgrim?

Diwali was celebrated in the Ashram. With the festival of lights setting in, fifty people got back their sight, while thousands got insights. Guruji told the meaning of Amma's name "Visalakshi" as "one with broad vision" on the First anniversary of Amma's MahaSamadhi.  "Broad vision gives you the Guru and in turn Guru gives you the broader vision."

Guruji was a State Guest in Orissa where he arrived after a brief Satsang in Chennai. Guruji went to Jagannath Puri, the Eastern seat of wisdom, where Vishnu Yagna was performed. Puri had a great satsang, where many people reported miraculous healing experiences. Report from Argentina tells us about the stunning experience of the medical team on the miraculous

disappearance of a malignant tumor where the patient was given 48 hours to live.

THE BODHI TREE

Buddha got enlightened under the Bodhi tree. He then stood up and watched the tree from a distance for seven days. He took sixteen steps towards the tree and under each step, blossomed a Lotus flower. This is the legend.

The Bodhi tree is symbolic of both sansara (world) and Dharma. The Lotus flower symbolizes clarity, dispassion, love, beauty and purity.

It is only when you are detached in life can you watch the sansara and all of its plays. When you witness the sansara, every step you take is benevolent and impeccable. When every action of yours is preceded by witnessing then every move you make in this sansara becomes perfect and significant.

 

 

NEWS FLASH

Guruji's entourage moved to Jamshedpur where a crowd of more than 20,000 was enthralled by the Master. Then on to Ranchi where another 60,000 were soaked in His Grace. Later in the night, Guruji met with more than a thousand villagers who came just to have a glimpse of Him.

The City of Joy (Calcutta) was full of enthusiasm. Guruji addressed the C.I.I. (Confederation of Indian Industries). Guruji's program in Calcutta was three satsangs - back to back over two days. Hundreds and thousands of people enjoyed the hospitality of West Bengal. Devotees were doubly stunned when an aggressive heckler was instantly transformed into a seeker and

danced in joy.

Then Guruji moved on to Gaya to offer tribute to His most beloved mother, our Amma, on her first death anniversary. And once again the Bodhi tree had another date with the Enlightened.

NIMIT  -  INSTRUMENT OF THE DIVINE

When you are neither clear nor confused, only then can you be a perfect instrument of the Divine! How would an instrument know what is going to be, and when? How can an instrument be confused, and how can an instrument be clear!

This state is called Nimit - just being an instrument of the Divine. Being very clear means not opening to new possibilities and can lead to limitations. Unlimited possibilities are open to one who is not clear and not confused.

Your mind swings from clarity to confusion and confusion to clarity but the state in which there is no doership nor inertia is the most creative and progressive state.

Sharmila: Will this not lead to lethargy?

Sri Sri: No. A sharp instrument does its job perfectly, effortlessly.

Sharmila: What about focus?

Sri Sri: Focus is natural to a dynamic consciousness.

Confusion arises when new information flows in and clarity is lost. Then confusion again seeks clarity. Clarity constricts the possibility of new information. A confused consciousness seeks clarity and every confusion is breaking away from clarity.

If there is only confusion, there is frustration. If there is only clarity, there is rigidity.

After giving contradictory knowledge, Krishna tells Arjuna, "Just be Nimit!" And to be an instrument, the prerequisite is to be madly in love! That's why in love there is neither confusion nor clarity; or there is both - confusion and clarity!

Nazreen: Is truth more important than love?

Sri Sri: I'm confused! Is it clear? (laughter)

THE PROBLEM'S SOLUTION

Whenever there is a problem we either deny it saying there is no problem or sit to solve the problem and make it a big issue. Neither of these help. A problem does not disappear when you deny it. And it does not get solved when you sit to solve it.

The 5 steps to solve a problem:

1. Acknowledge the problem - it is there.

2. See it as a small problem, and do not say it is big.

3. If it concerns people, keep in touch with them instead of avoiding them.

4. Talk less and give time a chance.

5. Get together and celebrate. When you celebrate and put the problem on the back burner you will see that the problem will get solved by the way.

So it is wise not to sit to solve a problem. Most of the meetings to solve problems end up in disaster.

If you do not have any problem, you will create problems for others! (laughter) If you have a small problem in your pocket to solve, it will give a focus to your mind. If you do not have any problems, you may be a problem for others.

It is better to have a problem than to be a problem.

NEWS FLASH The south zone organizers of India who came to solve problems finally found out that they had one problem: they had no problem.

In New Delhi, the Imam Maulana Illyasi, who is the president of the organization of Imams in India met with Guruji along with the Turkish delegation and participated in the satsang. Back in Bangalore, Guruji gave the concluding address at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

SACREDNESS AND YOU

Throughout the ages, in all cultures, place, time, persons and symbols were all considered sacred. Whenever you consider a symbol, place, time, person or act sacred, your attention is undivided and whole. When things are ordinary and same, you tend to slip into unawareness and inertia. The moment you consider something sacred, your inertia disappears and you become more alive. There is nothing as fulfilling as a sacred act. You put your heart and soul in a sacred act. When every action of yours becomes sacred, you have become one with the Divine. Then every minute of your life is sacred, every place you go to becomes sacred, every person you meet is only your reflection, and every act of yours is sacred.

Question: Why does an act when performed repeatedly lose it sacredness?

Sri Sri: This happens when your memory overpowers your consciousness and you lose your sensitivity. For example, people living in Benares do not feel that it is a sacred place. That sensitivity is just not there.

Question: How can we preserve that feeling of sacredness in our acts?

Sri Sri: Through living in the present moment and through Sadhana. Your Sadhana will not allow your memory to overpower consciousness. Repetition is not a hindrance then.

The Native American Indians and the tribals consider the earth, sun, moon and all the directions as sacred. In the ancient tradition, the Rishis considered all the rivers, mountains and even animals, trees and herbs as sacred. What to say of people? They are definitely sacred!

In different parts of the world, certain symbols, certain places and different times of the year are considered sacred. Various cultures honor certain people and consider them as sacred. For example, Christians consider the Cross, Jerusalem, Christmas and the Pope as sacred. For Muslims, the Crescent Moon, Mecca and the month of Ramadan are sacred. The Hindus consider the river Ganges, the Himalayas and the Swamis as sacred.

It is good to begin feeling that some symbols, places, time and people are sacred so that you can be awake and alive. But eventually you need to transcend and feel that the entire creation and your whole life is sacred. For the man of God, the whole world, with all its symbols, places and people are sacred at all times.

BE A MAN OF GOD!

I AM GOD

It was thought that to say, "I am God" is blasphemy.  I tell you, to say "I am not God" is blasphemy! When you say, "I am not God," you deny God of His omnipresence.

You are made up of love.  If you say, "I am not God," you are denying that God is love. If you are love and you say, "I am not God," you are saying God is not love, and that is blasphemy.

"I am" is your consciousness. If you say, "I am not God," you deny that God is aware, alert and awake.  You exist. When you say, "I am not God," you deny God of a portion of existence, and that is blasphemy.  Also, you are denying the scriptures that say, "God made man in His own image." If you say, "I am not God," you are denying God.

Question:  If God is omnipresent, why is there hatred and suffering in this world?

Sri Sri:  Just as in a movie, it doesn't matter whether it is a tragedy or a comedy, or one with a happy ending; in the Absolute there are no opposites. All the opposites are part of relative existence.

Relative existence is not the complete picture. Good and bad, right and wrong, everything is relative. For example, milk is good, but too much milk can kill you. A drop of poison can save a life (most medicines have "POISON" written on them). These are neither absolutely good nor bad; they are just there.

Truth transcends duality, and God is the absolute and only truth. In a movie, when light passes through the film, it doesn't matter to the light what the film is. Tragedy or comedy, hero or villain, the light is always there.

In the same way, no matter what is happening in your mind, YOU ARE GOD!

NEWS FLASH As soon as Guruji landed in Bombay, there was a Mahakriya for 15,000 people

followed by a Satsang of 50,000!

Art of Living was the most "happening" thing in all of Northern Kerala. The largest grounds and stadiums in every city were brimming over with jubilant faces. In Thrissur, 1 lakh people turned up for Satsang, in spite of a "bandh" and a complete transport strike! On to Palghat, where two lakh devotees eagerly welcomed the Master. Calicut, with over two lakh people, was next, and then came Kannur, a politically disturbed small town. All the different religious and political factions forgot their differences for a day, and sang united and strong in a Satsang of over two lakh people!

And then on to Mangalore for an intimate Satsang.

Guruji visited five major cities in five days, and many other cities in 10-15 minute stopovers. Each of these places had enthusiastically organized Satsangs with huge crowds.

ATHEISM IS NOT A REALITY

It is difficult to see God as formless and it is difficult to see God as form. The formless is so abstract and God in a form appears to be too limited. So some people prefer to be atheists.

Atheism is not a reality, it is just a matter of convenience. When you have a spirit of enquiry, or in search of truth, atheism falls apart. With a spirit of enquiry, you cannot deny something which you have not disproved. An atheist denies God without first disproving it. In order to disprove God, you must have enormous knowledge. And when you have enormous knowledge, you cannot disprove it! (laughter!)For one to say that something does not exist, one should know about the whole universe. So you can never be one hundred percent atheist. An atheist is only a believer who is sleeping!

For a person to say, "I don't believe in anything", means he must believe in himself - so he believes in himself about whom he does not even know!

An atheist can never be sincere because sincerity needs depth - and an atheist refuses to go to his depth. Because the deeper he goes, he finds a void, a field of all possibilities - he has to accept that there are many secrets he does not know. He would then need to acknowledge his ignorance, which he refuses to do, because the moment he is sincere, he seriously starts doubting his atheism. A doubt-free atheist is next to impossible! So you can never be a sincere and doubt-free atheist.

When the atheist realizes his ignorance, what does he do? Where does he go? Does he go to a Guru? What does a Guru do to him? (Wait for next week's knowledge!)

ATHEISM

Atheism is when one does not believe either in values or in the abstract. When an atheist comes to the Guru, what happens? You start experiencing your own form and discover that you are indeed formless, hollow and empty. And this abstract non-form in you becomes more and more concrete!!!

The guru makes the abstract more real and what you thought as solid appears to be more unreal. Sensitivity and subtlety dawns. Perception of love, not as an emotion, but as the substratum of existence becomes evident. The formless spirit shines through every form in creation and mystery of life deepens, shattering the atheism. Then the journey begins and it has four stages.

The first stage is Saarupya (to see the formless in the form) Ö Seeing God in all the forms. Often, one feels more comfortable to see God as formless rather than with a form, because with a form, one feels a distance, a duality, a fear of rejection and other limitations. In life all of our interactions are with the form, other than in deep sleep and in Samadhi. And, if you do not see God in the form, then the waking part of life remains devoid of the Divine. All those who accept God to be formless use symbols, and perhaps love the symbols more than God himself! If God comes and tells a Christian to leave the cross or a Muslim to drop the crescent, perhaps he may not do it! To begin with loving the formless is possible only through forms.

The second stage is Saamipya (closeness) Ö feeling absolutely close to the form you have chosen and reaching out to the formless. This leads to a sense of intimacy with the whole creation. In this stage, one overcomes the fear of rejection and other fears. But this is time and space bound.

The third stage is Saanidhya - feeling the presence of the Divine by which you transcend the limitations of time and space.

Then the final stage Ö Saayujya Ö is when you are firmly entrenched with the Divine. It is then you realize you are one with the Divine. There is a total merging with the Beloved and all duality disappears.

THIS IS THAT AND THAT IS THIS.

Vinod Mathur: Does a believer also go through these four stages?

Sri Sri: Certainly, whether an atheist or believer, he goes through the four stages.

NEWS FLASH The power of knowledge is obvious when impossible becomes possible. All arrangements for a mega event in Bangalore were made in just 4 days time, where Guruji and His Holiness the Dalai Lama addressed 150,000 people. His Holiness the Dalai Lama visited the ashram and addressed the advanced course participants and praised the Art of Living Foundation for its work towards enriching human values around the world.

The satsang was a historic moment - as Buddhist monks and Vedic pundits chanted, thousands from the stillness of meditation, started singing, dancing and celebrating with lit candles held in their hands.

Waves of love, light and joy permeated the atmosphere. Five thousand peace balloons were sent up in the air. As the crowd pleaded for more, Guruji led them through a second round of meditation. As if this was not enough, Guruji granted everyone one wish and the next day thousands of grateful calls were received.

TO SAY SORRY IS A GOOD MISTAKE?

Often, in establishing your righteousness, you are insensitive to othersÔ feelings. When someone is hurt, arguing with them and establishing your righteousness will be in vain. By saying a simple "Sorry", you can uplift the other and take away the bitterness. In many situations saying "Sorry" is better than establishing your righteousness. It can avert much unpleasantness.

This one word of five letters, when said sincerely can remove anger, guilt, hatred and distance.

Many people feel pride in hearing "Sorry" from others. This boosts their ego. But when you say "Sorry" to a wise man, it evokes compassion at your ignorance. However, when you say "Sorry" to your Guru, He will get angry and say, "Go! Listen to Ashtavakra!" (Laughter) For your saying "Sorry" indicates doership. You feel that YOU have MADE a mistake.

A mistake is part of an unconscious mind. An unconscious mind cannot do right. A conscious mind can do no wrong. The mind which makes the mistake and the mind which realizes the mistake - saying "Sorry" - are entirely different, arenÒ´ they? The mind which says "Sorry" cannot be an unconscious mind. Therefore, saying "Sorry" sincerely is a BIG MISTAKE!!!

Did you get it or are you confused? If you didn't get it, don't feel sorry orÅ¹ou can feel sorry!! (Laughter)

How strange - truth is paradoxical!

So sometime during the day, sit for a few minutes, get into the cave of your heart, eyes closed, and kick the world away like a ball.

But as soon as you open your eyes, hold onto the ball because you need to kick it again in the next session. (Laughter) During the day be 100 percent attached to the work, don't try to detach yourself. But when you sit for meditation, then totally detach yourself. Only those who can totally detach can take total responsibility.

Eventually you will be able to be both attached and detached simultaneously. Kick the ball and be in the goal! This is the art of living, the skill of living.

 

NEWS FLASH

250 people "kicked the ball" and welcomed the New Year in deep meditation with Guruji. The ashram, deep in snow that sparkles like diamonds, seems suitably decked out to receive Guruji on this first winter visit. The frozen lakes provide great 'skating' on afternoon walks (runs!) through the snow.

The City Council in Alpharetta, Georgia, USA, planned to remove several 150-year old oak trees as part of a street-widening project. The engineering firm, cable company, and phone company made their studies and gave approval. Local people who wanted to save the trees were told, "There's no hope; it's finished." A devotee put Guruji's picture on each tree and phoned the city officials to tell them the trees were protected by a saint. Word spread through the town and 300 protestors, along with full media coverage, showed up at the City Council. Plans were abandoned, and the trees are happily standing.

                                "IMPORTANT" AND "UNIMPORTANT"

So many people are stuck with what is "important". Why do you always have to do only that which is important? Most people are caught up thinking about what is important.

For something to be important, there need to be many things that are unimportant. So you cannot eliminate unimportant things. It is important to have unimportant things to make something else important. (Laughter.) Things are either themselves important or they make other things important. So that means everything is important, and. everything is unimportant.

When you realize this fact you become choiceless.

When you say something is important you are limiting your vastness.

A journalist asked me, "Why is it important to breathe?" "Why is it important to be happy?" "Why is it important to have peace?" These questions are not relevant at all. Why should you always look for what is important? Something that is unimportant can contribute to something that is important. And what is important and unimportant changes with time and space. Food is important when you are hungry and unimportant when you are full.

When something is inevitable you don't categorize it as important or unimportant. It is beyond choice.

"Everything is important" is karma yoga. "Nothing is important" is deep meditation.

A Montreal devotee who is a cab driver by profession picked up a passenger one night who appeared overcome by drugs and alcohol. The passenger demanded to be taken to his destination for half-fare, and when the driver protested he pulled a gun. At first the driver was afraid, but when he looked at the photo of Gurudev on the dashboard he felt completely protected. During the drive, the passenger put the gun away. Eventually he asked  who was the person in the photo. When they reached the destination, the passenger bowed to the picture and paid the driver the full fare along with a handsome tip.

WORSHIP A SIGN OF MATURITY

For a flame to go up, you need space above. In the same way, for a man to rise up in his life, he needs an ideal, he needs something to adore and worship. Worship is the culmination of love and appreciation. Worship prevents love from turning into hatred or jealousy, and appreciation into low self-esteem. In life, if you do not adore or appreciate anything, you will be filled with negativity. And a person who has nothing to worship or adore is sure to fall into depression.

Lack of adoration has led to many emotional, psychological and social problems in the society. If you have nothing to hold up high in life, selfishness, arrogance and violence are sure to follow. Adoring and honoring each other in society eliminates stress and fosters compassion and love.

In the previous century, it was thought that worshipping was an uncivilized and unintelligent thing to do. Worship was thought to rise from a slavish mentality. In fact it is just the contrary. Worship can only happen through gratefulness and not through slavish mentality.

In worship, a sense of belongingness, love, honor and respect all come together. Without a sense of belongingness, worship or idealism can bring low self-esteem. The ancient people knew this so they insisted that people should feel part of what they worship. They encouraged people to worship the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, plants, animals and people.

 

WORSHIP IN A TRUE SENSE IS A SIGN OF MATURITY AND NOT WEAKNESS.

Question: You said worship is the culmination of love. Does worship also have a culmination?

Answer: Culmination of worship is Self knowledge, Samadhi.

THE KUMBHA MELA

Once every 12 years, all the seers, saints and aspirants of spiritual knowledge congregate at the confluence (sangam), of the 3 holy rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. The Ganga is a symbol of Knowledge and Self-inquiry. It is on the banks of the Yamuna that events of love have been immortalized. When Knowledge and Love come together, when the head meets the heart, Saraswati, symbolic of wisdom and the fine arts emerge.

When a tiny atom explodes, the radiation lasts for a long time ... the mind is even more subtle than one millionth of an atom. When the mind explodes, that is Enlightenment.

Over the centuries, thousands of sages who have meditated, done penance and been enlightened come to the "Kumbha Mela" and relieve themselves of the burden of the merits gained through Sadhana by bathing in the rivers. Water has the quality to absorb the energy that they radiate. The seekers, who come from all corners to be in the company of the seers and saints, gain that merit when they take a dip in the rivers.

Space by itself cannot be bought, and a lump of clay has no value, but when space is enveloped by clay it gains value, this is a Kumbha (pot). Spirit is all over in Nature, but when it dawns in the human body as an elevated state of consciousness, then it gains immense value. An Embodied and elevated spirit is usually referred to as Kumbha. This is why the enlightened age is also called the Aquarian age. Kumbha denotes a pot, which is symbolic of fullness and perfection.

The Kumbha Mela is an ancient version of a spiritual expo.

NEWS FLASH Guruji was in Prayag for the Kumbha Mela. There were many very touching incidents that happened which show the depth of the devotion of the people who had gathered there. Here are two of them.

One morning, Guruji noticed an 80-year-old woman who had been separated from her folks. She looked tired and hungry. Guruji sent someone to give her some money, which she refused to accept saying that she had come here to give, not to take! Guruji Himself had to go to her and tell her that the money was prasad, which she then took from Him.

It was very cold there every night, the temperature dropping to 2 or 3 deg Celsius, and a lot of people had no accommodation whatsoever and would just sleep in the sand on the banks of the rivers, most of them not even having a shawl to cover themselves with. Guruji along with some yuvacharyas and other devotees would go and distribute a lot of blankets every night to these people. Thousands of blankets were distributed every night One night, they came across a teenager who was shivering with cold and gave him some blankets to cover himself with, which he refused to take saying, that he could bear this cold, and that there were so many others who would need them much more than him.

Guruji later told everyone to note the devotion and the total surrender of these people who even in such desperate circumstances had such absolute faith in the Divine and knew that He would provide for them.

Our Ashram was bustling with activity all day long and attracted many people; food was being served continuously, throughout the day. The community of saints there was overjoyed to meet with Guruji and lauded the work of Art of Living.

Back in Delhi Guruji had very fruitful meetings with various leaders including the leader of Jamma Masjid.

THE OTHER SIDE OF FRIENDLINESS

Secretaries, police, judges, accountants and people in key positions should not be friendly!

The main disadvantages of being friendly are:

1. You come under obligation

2. You lose your freedom

3. You can't have a free and fair perception. Your thoughts and actions may not be impartial

4. Your focus, commitment, creativity and above all your time will be wasted

5  You will pick up bad habits and negative moods easily

It takes a lot of wisdom to be free from the burden of obligation and not be influenced by your friends' opinions and feelings.

In many occasions, it is better to be unfriendly than be friendly. Being unfriendly does not mean being aggressive and inimical. The best secretaries, personal assistants, security personnel, and judges have to be unfriendly.

Those who are aloof and indifferent get centered more quickly than those who are too friendly. A certain degree of aloofness in every relationship will strengthen your personality and connect you to your source.

Vinod Sethi: It's very easy to be very aloof or very friendly. But to be friendly and aloof is a Sadhana.

Harish: Be an unfriendly friend!!

LONGING ITSELF IS DIVINE

 

Longing itself is Divine.

Longing for worldly things makes you inert.

Longing for Infinity fills you with life.

 

When longing dies, inertia sets in. But longing also brings along a sense of pain. To avoid the pain, you try to push away the longing. The skill is to bear the pain of longing and move on. Don't try to find a shortcut to overcome longing. Don't make the longing short - that's why it's called loooonging. (Laughter)

 

True longing in itself brings up spurts of bliss. That's why in ancient days longing was kept alive by singing and listening to kathas (stories).

 

When longing transcends relationships, judgments, jealousy and all other negative feelings drop off. It is only with wisdom and self-knowledge that you can transcend relationships. People often think wisdom is devoid of longing - No! Such wisdom is dry. The longing that comes in true wisdom makes life juicier. Divine is certainly juicy!

 

Longing gives you the power to bless. Bless the entire creation. For, the longing in you is God.

BACK TO SPACE

From time to time the earth shakes and in its shaking wakes up the man who is in slumber, who not only misuses Nature but puts his faith in bricks and mortar. Your true security is in the Self not in bricks and mortar. Perhaps this is what Nature wants to convey to you. Earthquakes, floods and volcanoes all drive home the truth that nothing is permanent and you cannot find security in that which is not permanent. They all come to you as a shock and wake you up.

When such calamities occur we try to understand their cause so that we can blame someone. Strangely, when you find someone to blame you feel comfortable, but with natural calamities you cannot blame anyone. It comes to you as a shock. With wisdom, shocks can make you grow in leaps and bounds. Without wisdom a shock can only lead you to negativity and depression.

Q. Why should nature destroy small innocent children?

A. Nature just does its job. It does not discriminate between young and old. Do you think that all those who eat bamboo shoots and eggs or pluck flower buds are not compassionateÅ maybe, maybe not! (laughterÅ©

Instead of questioning Nature, wake up and see the opportunity for seva (service). See whatÒ³ happening in Gujarat now. Today, hundreds and thousands are engaged in service activities that would not have happened otherwise. One positive thing coming out of destruction is the reconstruction of Gujarat which would not have happened if not for earthquake. Another interesting factor is a fresh water spring that has appeared in a region that has been continuously drought prone.

Wisdom is to consider the earth as your Valentine. Whether it shakes or breaks, it is dear to you. You always see good coming from it.

The four elements, other than space, create turbulence from time to time. If you depend on them for support, they will shake you and lead you back to space.

Finding security in inner space is spirituality.

NEWS FLASH Guruji was a state guest in Andhra Pradesh. His talk to the government officials was greatly appreciated by the Chief Minister. Guruji was invited to come and deliver more programs in the state of Andhra Pradesh. That evening there was a mammoth satsang.

The Art of Living Foundation has adopted 26 villages in Kutch-Bhuj, the earthquake-hit area of Gujarat.

Rajani, (25yrs old) from Bangalore, all of a sudden completely lost her hearing (sensorineural hearing loss) on 9th Dec 2000. The world had become silent to her. Medical experts, after diagnosis and treatment, declared no possibility of regaining her hearing. After attending the first day of the residential basic course at the Ashram on 19th Jan 2001, she miraculously regained her hearing. Where medical science had failed, her Guru's grace transformed her life.

Research at the All India Institute of Medical Science showed significant changes in the brain wave patterns of the AOL teachers who participated in the study. All 18 subjects were found to maintain high integrity and awareness during activity.

PASSION AND SELF-RELIANCE

Passion makes you weak. Dispassion is strength.

For your passion to be fulfilled, you have to depend upon so many things. Passion and self-reliance do not appear to go together. If you are passionate, you have to forget about being self-reliant. If you want to be self-reliant, you have to drop your passion. This is generally so

That which brings together these two completely different aspects in you, is your spirit. The same spirit that wants to be self-reliant is also passionate. It is only in spirituality that passion and dispassion can happen together. This is the rarest combination.

When you are dispassionate, you have strength, and strength is self-reliance. True self-reliance is realizing that nothing is excluded from the Self. And when you realize everything is part of the Self, then you can be passionate about everything! Even to fulfill your passion, you can only rely on the Self, for Self alone is non-changing.

In Truth, there is neither reliance nor passion. In one state, you can either be passionate or you can be self-reliant. But in an elevated state of consciousness, you can be neither, or both!

The celebrations continued until early morning as devotees queued for darshan.

THE OTHER SIDE OF FEAR

The Usefulness of Fear

Nature has put an amount of inbuilt fear in all living beings. This fear makes life defend itself, protect itself. Like salt in the food, a little bit of fear is essential for people to be righteous.

Fear of hurting someone makes you more conscious.

Fear of failure makes you more keen and dynamic.

Fear moves you from carelessness to taking care.

Fear moves you from being insensitive to being sensitive.

Fear moves you from dullness to alertness.

Total lack of fear may lead to destructive tendencies - a distorted ego knows no fear. Neither does the expanded consciousness! Whereas the ego dismisses the fear and moves in a disruptive manner, the wise one acknowledges the fear and takes refuge in the Divine.

When you are in love, when you are surrendered, there is no fear. Ego, too, knows no fear. But there is a difference, like that of heaven and earth, between these two types of fearless states.

Fear makes you righteous; fear brings you close to surrender; fear keeps you on the path; keeps you from being destructive. Peace and law are maintained on the planet because of fear.

A new-born child knows no fear - it totally relies on its mother. Whether a child, a kitten or a bird, when they start becoming independent they experience fear which makes them go running back to their mothers.  This is inbuilt by nature to sustain life.

So, the purpose of fear is to bring you back to the source!!

NEWS FLASH Guruj's entire journey from Bombay to Surat was punctuated by Darshan. Enthusiastic devotees, in hundreds, thronged every station. 40,000 attended the live Kriya in Surat setting off a wave of energy, culminating in a high-vol satsang of over 300,000 people.

On to Ahmedabad, where Guruji's meeting with the Chief Minister and bureaucrats proved extremely useful. Guruji suggested drastic changes in the lay-out plan of the 900 quake-hit villages which are to be rebuilt. His ideas were greatly appreciated and immediately incorporated.

Guruji wondered whether He was awakening people or not, but devotees who showed up all night at different stations between Ahmedabad and Udaipur, armed with musical bands, definitely kept waking everyone up with their fervor!

Guruji's first ever visit to the City of Jheels (lakes), Udaipur, saw a grand satsang. He also met with NGO's and gave a highly illuminating talk on Integrated Social Development. Gliding softly over the moon-lit waters in a boat to the glittering Jagmandir, He was given a royal reception and the satsang happened in regal splendour!

"When the Divine dwells in your heart, the whole world appears to you as a temple¦quot;

Guruji's entourage decided that it was high time He stopped traveling by train. On the last leg of this wonderfully eventful trip from Udaipur to Delhi, there was a brief stop-over for 20 minutes at Jaipur where a welcome stage and over a thousand devotees compelled Guruji to deplane and give Darshan right there, even at the airport, where Satsang happened spontaneously!!!

The Other Side Of Ego

Ego is an impediment for a leader, wise man, merchant or a servant, but it is a necessity for a warrior, a competitor.

A warrior is one who takes on challenges and commitment and stands by it.

Ego makes one sacrifice oneself for a cause. Ego gives strength and courage, brings valour to meet the challenges with endurance and perseverance. A strong ego will counteract depression. Often ego is thought to be selfish but it is the greatest motivating factor for creativity and generosity.

Ego propels one to venture into the unknown.

There are 3 types of ego - Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic.

Tamasic ego is barbaric and blind, and has self-destructive tendencies.
Rajasic ego is self-centered and causes misery to oneself and others.
Sattvic ego is creative and has protective tendencies.
If you cannot surrender, at least have a Sattvic ego, as a Sattivic ego is always ready to sacrifice.

Bhanu: This is very good! It gives many people a relief. (laughter!)

THE PARADOX OF SACRIFICE

All the scriptures of the world glorify sacrifice. What is sacrifice?

It is giving up something that you value. You can only sacrifice that which you would like to keep for yourself; in other words, that which gives you pleasure and joy. You cannot sacrifice something that you dislike or disown. Sacrifice is always related to a higher cause for a greater good. At the same time, when your love for the greater good is so strong, nothing else assumes any value. Sacrifice here becomes irrelevant, because love alone is your strongest driving force. So when there is so much love there cannot be sacrifice. At the same time when there is no love, there is no sacrifice.

For example, if a mother has made plans to see a movie and she realizes that her child is sick, she does not say that she has sacrificed the movie to nurse her child, because she simply did not want to go. Nothing else seems to charm the mother besides being with her child.

You do not sacrifice something for someone you are in love with. Sacrifice indicates that your pleasure has more value than the cause for which you are sacrificing. When the love is lukewarm, then sacrifice assumes meaning. Yet sacrifice purifies the human mind and reins in selfish tendencies. It can also bring pride, arrogance, self-pity and sometimes even depression.

You can sacrifice only that which you value. For a wise man nothing is more valuable than truth, values and the Divine, and he will never sacrifice those. God is the greatest, and if he values the greatest then how can he sacrifice God? This is the paradox of sacrifice.

DIVINE IN THE FORM AND FORMLESS

 

Divinity is unmanifest, but man has an innate desire to perceive the divine in the manifest creation around him. He creates idols, breathes faith into it and requests divinity to be present in that idol for a while, so that he can worship, express his love and play with it. At the end of his worship he requests divinity to go back into his heart from where divinity manifested. This is in all puja practices.

They are not actually worshipping the idols but worshipping the unmanifest divinity which has all the divine qualities. So, the idol worshippers of the East are not the same as the ones in the Middle East as described in the Bible, because they are not just worshipping different gods and different idols, they are worshipping the ONE divinity in many different forms.

Paganism, Satan and animal worship, without the knowledge of the one divinity is very different from seeing the divine in every form of the manifest universe. In the eastern tradition, gods and goddesses are part of the one divinity like the different colors of white sunlight, whereas in the Greek tradition, gods and goddesses are in themselves different entities.

Worshipping Satan and different entities is totally different from worshipping divinity in its various forms. Every form belongs to the divine. When you adore the form, you are adoring the divine behind the form.

With this knowledge, the very act of worship, which is more an inner phenomenon, assumes a more colorful and vibrant expression, indicating that both the form and the formless are all divine.

5H WALK REPORT: 25,000 people in 30 cities on 5 continents participated in the first Walk for 5H on Sunday, March 11, 2001, which evolved into the 5H Walk for Gujarat after the recent earthquake in India.

The initial seed was planted by Bawa as he toured the US teaching DSN courses last fall, where course participants took responsibility for organizing a 5H walk in their local area as a follow-up seva project. One thing led to another, and soon, cities all around the world had signed up to participate in this unique global 5H event, where all the participating cities walked to raise awareness and funds for 5H projects already taking place in the earthquake-affected areas of Gujarat.

Walk coordinators quickly realized that organizing a walk was no small feat - it required a committed team of volunteers to carefully plan and execute the many details involved. Some had to overcome many obstacles in pulling a team together. But after the event everyone had experienced such overwhelming personal growth. Amit from Boston said, "I had always thought that a lot of my buttons were dead. I worked through the last one month with so many of my buttons getting pushed, with tons and tons of grumbling and complaining. Even with so much awareness I could not change the state of my mind. But just as the walk ended on Sunday, something flipped and I felt centered again. This was sooo amazing!"

The overwhelming grace of the Guru was the invisible hand that guided all those involved. Madhu from Washington DC said, "Just 3 days before the event we had no media coming but we decided to call the major press and news channels anyway. Early on Sunday morning, NBC, CBS and FOX were all eagerly awaiting to televise the event even before the volunteers had turned up, and The Washington Post (the major local newspaper) came to cover the event. I just can't understand how this happened - this is simply unheard of!" Senator Hillary Clinton also sent a personal letter strongly supporting the walk. She said, "I am grateful for your dedication to this important cause. It is my hope that your efforts will inspire others to take part in actions large and small, public and private, to uplift individuals, families, communities and nations throughout our global society."

The skillful combination of buzzing daily satsangs balanced with die-hard seva warriors scouring the streets late into the night ensured that everyone in Dallas knew about 5H and the walk. "20,000 people know about the walk here. There is not one street corner we've left unturned. The energy here is unbelievable," said James Paul.

The walk was a perfect symbol of harmony in diversity, pulling together diverse groups of people from several communities. Jeffrey from Jakarta said, "300 Jakarta citizens, some coming by chartered buses as far as 1.5 hours away, came to walk for 5H. Participants came from diverse nationalities and religious beliefs. A catholic organization, St. Karnaius, even provided an ambulance to cover the walk."

The Maha 5H walk took place in Mumbai. Here the walk started from 5 different points of a circle, each group converging at the center of the circle, the landmark Shivaji Park. The first group to arrive at the park was met within minutes by all the other groups who also converged at the park like clockwork. The post-event celebrations started with a street play symbolizing the 5H's and culminated into a rocking satsang of 5,000. Dinesh noted, "There was definitely a Harmony in Diversity. Not only Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, the Maharashtrians, the Gujaratis and the South Indians but also the young and the old, the rich and the poor walked shoulder to shoulder and sang heart to heart."

And finally, once it was all over, Ashish from Dallas exclaimed, "Hey guys, it's not over! This was just the first step."

STRENGTH AND SUBORDINATION

Many people do not want to work under someone else, be it in their profession, in any company or even voluntary service. The general notion is that when you work under someone, you lose your freedom, you have to be answerable.

So, many people opt for business, wanting to be their own boss. But, in business, you are accountable to so many people. If you cannot be accountable to even one person, how can you be accountable to many? This is the paradox. In fact, being in business binds you more than the boss!

Refusing to work under someone is a sign of weakness, not strength. A strong person would not feel uncomfortable working under anyone, because he knows his strength. It is the weak and poor in spirit who do not like to work under someone else, because they are unaware of their strength. They can be neither successful in business nor in any profession.

And the same is true even in the field of social service - often volunteers do not want to work under someone else. This is merely an exhibition of their weakness. With such an attitude, they achieve very little.

One who is timid and weak in spirit would be uncomfortable to work even under the Wise one; but one who knows his own strength can work effectively even under a fool!

Nityanand: But to work under a fool is frustrating!

SriSri: When you know your strength, with skill and intelligence, you can turn every disadvantage into an advantage. A fool can bring out the best of your communication skills! (laughter)

So watch out! If you feel uncomfortable working under someone, it clearly shows you need to strengthen yourself. Desiring freedom from circumstances, situations or people is no freedom at all. Knowing that nobody can take away your freedom Ö that is strength! And when you realize your strength is unshakable, you would not mind working under anybody.

COMMITMENT AND CONVENIENCE

A commitment can only be felt when it oversteps convenience. That which is convenient, you do not call commitment. If you just go on your convenience, your commitment falls apart causing more inconvenience! If you keep dropping your commitment because it is inconvenient, can you be comfortable? Often, what is convenient does not bring comfort, but gives an illusion of comfort. Also if you are too stuck in commitment, and it is too inconvenient too often, you will be unable to fulfill your commitment and it will only generate frustration. Wisdom is to strike a balance between convenience and commitment because both bring comfort to the body, mind and spirit.

A seeker of knowledge should forget about convenience, so should soldiers, rulers, students, seekers of wealth and all essential service providers. Those who want to be creative and adventurous transcend convenience. Those who are ambitious and have a passion for a goal do not care for convenience. To the wise their commitment is their comfort. Whenever their commitment is shaken, their comfort is also shaken. To the lazy, commitment is torture though it is the best remedy.

Commitment will always bring comfort in the long run.

Question: Are there any commitments that can be given up?

Answer: Yes.

Sometimes when you are committed without a vision, you feel stifled when your vision expands. Such commitments made with shortsightedness can be given up.
A smaller less important commitment can be given up for a greater commitment.
Commitment to the means can be given up for the sake of the commitment to the goals.
When your commitment brings misery to many in the long run it can be given up.
Knowledge splash!

Guruji held up a pistachio nut and asked every one. "What is this?" Everybody said, "Pistachio." Guruji held up a pistachio nut without the shell and asked every one, "What is this?" Everybody said, "Pistachio." Guruji then held up the shell and asked everyone, "What is this?" Every body said, "Shell."

Guruji said, "As the nut with or without the shell is pistachio, similarly spirit with or without the body is God. But just as the shell without the nut is not pistachio, the body without spirit is not God. Spirit is certainly God because it is present everywhere. The body is certainly not God because it cannot be present everywhere."

When someone asks you, "Are you God?" Who is the question addressed to? As it is only the spirit that answers, you have no choice but to say, "Yes!" There was a blissful glee on everyoneÒ³ faces.

God is within the body and God embodies the whole universe. Those who have eyes will see. (When asked, "Are you God?"- This is the best answer.)

DEALING WITH BLAME AND ACCUSATION


When someone blames you, you feel a heavy load on your head, and when you talk about it you spread the unpleasant feeling all around you. At this moment wake up and see you are Being and nothing can touch you. This is all just a drama, which you yourself have created. You have gone through this over and over again. All the blames you face in your life are your own creation. Knowing this, you feel free and light.

Owning responsibility for all your experiences in life makes you powerful and will put an end to grumbling, planning counter attacks, explanations, and all those host of negative tendencies. Owning full responsibility you become free.

When someone blames you, directly or indirectly, what do you do?

Do you register it in your mind and get emotionally upset?
Do you dismiss them altogether without taking a lesson from it?
Do you talk about it with people and waste your time and otherÒ³ time and money?
Do you pity yourself and blame your shortcomings?
Do you blame the other person right, left and center?
Do you generalize and eternalize the problem?

Then you are not living up to the knowledge. You need to do the basic course at least half a dozen times and read all the previous knowledge sheets.

Do you laugh at it and not even take notice of it?
Do you treat it as a non-event, not even worth talking about, let alone taking any action?
Do you treat comments and accusations as passing clouds and more of an entertainment?
Do you discourage dwelling on unpleasant and negative moments?
Do you remain non-judgmental and absolutely unshaken in your space of love?
Outwardly you may be calm, but do you also remain centered and calm within you and not even take pride in your growth or wisdom?

Then you are a pride to your tutor - the Master.



You cannot take credit for loving Guruji or any wise person, as you have no choice at all as it will happen against all odds!

To love someone whom you like is not a big deal at all.
To love someone because they love you, you get zero marks.
To love someone whom you do not like, you have learned a lesson in life.
To love someone who blames you for no reason, you have learned the art of living.

NEWS FLASH A gentleman complained to Guruji about how some people have ganged up against him and blame him. Guruji gave a patient hearing, with a few comments in between. The person felt he gained some sympathy and as he started feeling righteous, Guruji shot back saying, "You have already wasted enough of your time. Why do you want to waste mine also! You only get what you have sown!"

Suddenly the whole atmosphere became serene and smiles returned.

SELF CONFIDENCE AND AMBITION


Ambition indicates lack of self-confidence!

When you know you can achieve something easily, you are not ambitious about it. You are simply confident about it. Your ambition indicates challenge and uncertainty, which is contrary to self-confidence. So one you has total self-confidence cannot be ambitious!!

At the same time a person who lacks total self-confidence cannot be ambitious either!!

For ambition to be, one must have a little bit of confidence and total ignorance of the Self.

It is next to impossible to have total confidence without Self-knowledge.

With the knowledge of the Self, there is nothing left to achieve, for the entire nature of existence is mere

play and display of one's own consciousness.

People take pride in being ambitious. The wise man will only smile at them. Ambition can never be for

something you know you can achieve effortlessly. You can only be ambitious about something for which you have to put effort, which poses a challenge and of which you are not even certain you will be able to achieve or not.

Moreover it takes away the joy of the moment.

With the Self-knowledge nothing is challenging to you, nor you need to put any effort. Nature is ready to

fulfill your intention even before they arise, giving you no chance to crave or desire. Nature does not

allow the wise to have a desire (ambition), and the unwise to fulfill or get rid of the desire (ambition).

Do you still want to be ambitious ?? Or is your only ambition is to get rid of ambition !!

(Laughter )

THE DANGERS OF BELONGINGNESS AND ADVANTAGES OF OBLIGATIONS

Belongingness can bring about a host of negative emotions. Like demand, jealousy, unawareness and lack of gratitude. Just look into your own life, you feel more grateful to strangers than the people you feel "belong" to you. Belongingness reduces gratefulness, awareness, and gives rise to demands which destroys love. This is the biggest problem in relationships. People are nice to strangers and give more attention to them. With a sense of belongingness comes carefreeness and lack of attention.

Look belongingness can make you insensitive, dull, and take away the charm in life!

Anyway, who belongs to whom in this world? Here you are a stranger and everyone is a stranger to you!

Blessed are those who feel themselves as a stranger!

You feel more obligation to a stranger than the person you feel belongs to you. Obligation is very good to keep a check on your ego. It makes you humble. There is no greater antidote to ego than humility. Being humble is the beginning of all virtues.

People have such resistance for obligations. They do not realize that they are always under obligations, whether giving or taking! Dull people think that one is obliged only when one takes. The wise knows that even when one is giving one is under obligations, as the person has accepted what one gives. So whether you give or take you are under obligations. And if someone does not give or take, you are still under obligation! For they are freeing you from visible obligations!!

That is to say, you are obliged to all those who do not make you obliged!!! A Got it?

Life (you) renews itself everytime by becoming a stranger in this old and familiar world.

You are simply loaded with obligations and you are a total stranger in this world every moment!

How does it feel (Laughter!)

PRESTIGE AND HONOR, YOUR GOLDEN CAGE

Honor reduces the freedom. Your fame, honor and virtue can limit your freedom.

Nobody expects a good person to make a mistake. So the better person you are, the higher the expectations people have of you. It is then that you lose your freedom. Your virtues and good actions are like a golden cage. You are trapped by your own good actions, for everyone expects more from a good person. Nobody expects anything from a bad person.

Most of the people are stuck in this cage of prestige and honor. They can not smile. They are constantly worried about keeping up their prestige and their honor. It becomes more important than their own life. Just being good or doing good to keep the prestige and honor is worthless. Prestige and honor can bring more misery in life than poverty.

Many desire fame, but little do they know that they are looking for a cage.

It is an art to be dignified, and yet not be suffocated by it. Only the wise would know this. For the wise one it is natural to be in honor, and he has no concerns even if it falls apart. Despite having fame or prestige, he will live as though he has none.

A wise person can handle any fame without feeling suffocated, for he is crazy too!

By doing good in the society one gains prestige, then enjoying the prestige and honor, one loses their freedom.

 

Question: Then how do you keep your freedom?

Answer: By being like a child, considering the world as a burden a joke or a dream.

to be continued.

Life is a Dream, a Burden or a Joke

(Continued from last week's Knowledge sheet)

Often when you are happy you feel life is a dream because you do not believe in the reality of it.  When there is misery you feel life as a burden.  And we take trivial things very seriously.  But one who has really gone through the pleasure realizes that pleasure is a burden.  And if you have undergone misery thoroughly you will realize that life is a dream.  In every miserable condition you have been walked or carried through and you realize life is a dream.  When you see life is dream a burden or a joke only then can you be centered.

And when you have really gone through misery you have really seen life as a dream.  And in between the pain and pleasure life is all a joke.

Life is very uncertain.  Before it takes you away, realize it is a dream, a burden or a joke. 

Someone asked:  What about life is a joke? 

Answer:  A joke you do not question.  If you question a joke, it is no longer a joke.  Do not question a burden either.  It is a waste of time to question life and its events. 

The burden makes you go deep.  It gets you to the core of yourself. 

Realization of a dream wakes you up.  And seeing life as a joke makes you light.

The only certainty is that life is a dream, a burden or a joke and only when you realize this can you be centered.

Reason and Faith

Reason is reeling in the known. Faith is moving in the unknown.
Reason is repetition. Faith is exploration.
Reason is routine. Faith is adventure.

They are completely opposite, yet an integral part of life.

Not having faith itself is misery; faith gives instant comfort. While reasoning keeps you sane and grounded, no miracle can happen without faith. Faith takes you beyond limitations. In faith you can transcend the laws of nature but it needs to be pure. Faith is beyond reason, yet you need to have faith in your own reasoning! (A sentence to be pondered on.) Faith and reason cannot exist without each other. Every reason is based on some faith. Whenever reason or faith breaks, confusion and chaos prevails which is often a step for growth.

There are two types of faith. Faith out of fear, greed and insecurity; and faith born out of love like the faith between the mother and the child, the Master and disciple. Whereas the faith out of love cannot be broken, faith out of fear and greed is shaky.

An atheist bases himself on reason, and a believer on faith. A believer uses God as an insurance policy! He thinks he is special. In the eyes of God there is no "mine" and "others"; all are the same. An atheist rationalizes to keep his eyes shut to reality. Death shakes them both! When someone close dies, an atheist eyes are opened, and a believerÒ³ faith cracks. Only a Yogi - a wise one - remains unshaken. For that person has transcended both reason and faith.

You need a balance between faith and reason.

Doing Trivial Things

What is that you can do for eternity? Definitely not anything that is big or great because it needs effort and effort tires you. So, it is a temporary state. If you can think of one thing that is way below your capacity to do and agree to do it for eternity, that becomes Pooja.

The readiness to consciously do trivial things for eternity unites you with eternity. This is an antidote to ego. Ego is always ambitious and wants to do the toughest job like climbing Mount Everest etc. Whereas in a simple act like watching a butterfly, watering the garden, watching the birds or the sky, can bring deep relaxation, and relaxation connects you with your source. Not that you do trivial things all your life, but consciously agreeing to do the trivial actions for eternity, opens a new dimension and brings in immense peace and restfulness.

To find rest in activity, choose an activity that is far below your capacity and agree to do it until eternity. Doing a job far below your capacity and being satisfied with it will make it possible to do a job much beyond your capacity.

Know that all actions are born out of infinity and that which is born out of infinity can take you to infinity.

Joy and Sorrow

The inability to experience joy and sorrow is inertia.

Experiencing joy and sorrow is a trait of consciousness.

Being happy in one's own joy and sad in one's own sorrow is a trait of animals.

Being happy at another's joy and saddened by another's sorrow is a trait of humans.

If you are saddened by other’s sorrow then sorrow will never come to you.

If you are happy at another's joy then joy will never leave you.

Seeing that every relative joy is also a misery is a sign of dispassion.

And seeing both joy and sorrow as just a technique is a sign of the wise.

Considering sorrow as mere illusion is divinity.

Transcending joy and sorrow and being established in the self is perfection.

As the late Swami Sharanananda used to say, "Pray for the strength to serve in joy and to sacrifice in sorrow."

DEEP REST AND BLISS

Deep rest is bliss, and bliss is the understanding that only God exists. Knowing that only God exists is the deepest rest possible.

This conviction or experience that "only God exists" is Samadhi. Samadhi is the mother of all talents, strengths and virtues. Samadhi is needed even for the most materialistic person because a materialistic person looks to gain strength and virtues. To be in Samadhi you do not need any effort or talents, strengths or virtues.

Withdrawing from all types of physical and mental activity is rest. That is in-built in our system as sleep, and sleep is the best friend of activity. Samadhi is a conscious rest. Samadhi is the best friend of life. To be alive in your full potential, Samadhi is indispensable.

What obstructs Samadhi is restlessness. How many types of restlessness are there and what are the remedies? ... The answers next week.

Five Types of Restlessness

There are five types of restlessness.

The first type of restlessness is due to the place you are in. When you move away from that place, the street or the house, you immediately feel better. Chanting, singing, children playing and laughing can change this atmospheric restlessness. If you chant and sing, the vibration in the place changes.

The second type of restlessness is in the body. Eating the wrong food or vata aggravating food, eating at odd times, not exercising, and overworking can all cause a physical restlessness. The remedy for this is exercise, moderation in work habits and going on a vegetable or juice diet for one or two days.

The third type of restlessness is mental restlessness. It is caused by ambition, strong thoughts, likes or dislikes. Knowledge alone can cure this restlessness. Seeing life from a broader perspective, knowledge about the Self and the impermanence of everything. If you achieve everything, so what? After your achievement, you will die. Knowledge of your death or life, confidence in the Self, in the Divine, can all calm down the mental restlessness.

Then there is emotional restlessness. Any amount of knowledge does not help here. Only Kriya helps! All that emotional restlessness vanishes. Also the presence of the Guru, a wise person, or a saint will help to calm your emotional restlessness.

The fifth type of restlessness is rare. It is the restlessness of the soul. When everything feels empty and meaningless, know you are very fortunate. That longing and restlessness is the restlessness of the soul. Do not try to get rid of it. Embrace it! Welcome it! Usually to get rid of it people do all sorts of things - they change places, jobs or partners, do this, do that. It seems to help for some time, but it does not last.

This restlessness of the soul alone can bring authentic prayer in you. It brings perfection, Siddhis and miracles in life. It is so precious to get that inner most longing for the Divine. Satsang, the presence of the enlightened one, soothes the restlessness of the soul.

News Flash: After a memorial satsang in the biggest cathedral in Berlin, Guruji moved on to London. In Westminster Abbey, and the town hall of Brent Town, satsang exploded with enthusiastic devotees. Guruji inaugurated our new center in London. Excellent teamwork marked Guruji’s much waited London tour. On the 13th he arrived in Strasbourg to deliver a talk at the European Parliament. It was presided by Reinholt Messner, the famous mountaineer and Peter von Kohl, the president of the organization of journalists of the European Parliament.

TENDENCIES AND INFLUENCES

 

Life moves by dual (two) factors: inner tendencies and outer influences.

Inner tendencies form your attitudes and behavior, while external influences makes strong impressions in your mind. Often your tendencies generate external situations. And situations around you can form tendencies within you. This is what is called Karma. Both these factors - the tendencies from within and influences from outside, can either be beneficial or harmful.

It is the awareness that filters the outer negative influences and it is the awareness that corrects and annihilates the unhealthy inner tendencies. This awareness is called Gyana. The purpose of education is to develop this awareness, so that you can be selective about your tendencies and influences.

It is practically impossible to resist the external influences and the inner tendencies without raising one’s consciousness. This can be gradual or sudden. And that is how a human being has both free will and destiny.

Freedom is when you have a say about your tendencies and your influences. And only awareness and impeccable devotion can bring this freedom.

 

Guruji's address to the Protestant Christian Congregation in Germany was simply brilliant. Denmark, Sweden and Norway had enthralling Satsangs. He is moving on to the Advanced Course in Gotenborg.

 AUTHENTICITY AND SKILLFULNESS

 Authenticity and skillfulness appear to be contradictory, but in fact they are complementary. Your intentions need to be authentic and your actions need to be skillful. The more authentic the intention, the more skillful the action will be. Authentic intention and skillful action make you unshakable.

 Skill is required only when authenticity cannot have its way. Yet skill without authenticity makes you shallow. You cannot have an authentic action and a skillful intention. If you try to be authentic in your action but manipulative in your mind, that is when mistakes happen.

 John: Is it possible to have a powerful intention, like greed, that is authentic?

Sri Sri: If your intention is colored by greed, over-ambition, etc. then your intention is not authentic. Whenever your intentions are impure, it pricks your consciousness, so it cannot be authentic. Authentic intentions are free from negative emotions. An action that is not skillful leads to negative emotions and an intention that is not authentic harbors negative emotions.

 Gayatri: If our intention is authentic and yet our actions are not skillful, what should we do?

Sri Sri: Carry a handkerchief (laughter).

 Question: What is the best skill to deal with intention?

Sri Sri: Do not keep any sankalpas (intentions) to yourself. Offer them to the Divine.

 Actions can never be perfect but our intentions can be perfect. Actions always have room for improvement. Action means growth and movement, and that needs space.

 The depth in you and the freedom in you bring out all the skillfulness in you. Krishna was the most skillful because his silence was so deep.

 TIME, SPACE AND MIND

Become God to each other. Do not look for God somewhere in the sky, but see God in every pair of eyes, in the mountains, water, trees and animals. How? Only when you see God in yourself. Only Gods can worship Gods. To recognize divinity, there are three dimensions: time, space and mind.

For a seeker, it is necessary to honor time and space so he or she can experience sacredness in his or her mind. When you honor time and space, your mind becomes alert. But for the one who has transcended the mind, either sacredness has no meaning, or all time, every place and every mood is sacred.

Precious moments are few in life. Catch them and treasure them. Place, time, mood of mind are factors that influence celebration. Snatch every opportunity to celebrate, then you feel great and full. Then celebration infiltrates your mind in all moods and space, and celebration is inevitable. Celebration reminds you of the fullness of the moment. The moments you are in the company of knowledge - the Master - are the most precious moments in your life. Treasure them. Treasuring them you transcend the mind, time and space. And that is true celebration.

 MISTAKES

Mistakes keep happening all the time. Often you get irritated by them and want to correct them. How much can you correct?  There are two situations when you correct other’s mistakes:

1. You correct someone’s mistake because it bothers you. But even if you correct it, this does not work.

2. You correct someone’s mistake, not because it bothers you, but for their sake so that they can grow.

To correct mistakes you need authority and love. Authority and love seem to be contradictory, but in reality they are not. Authority without love is stifling and does not work. Love without authority is shallow. A friend needs to have both authority and love but they need to be in the right combination. This can happen if you are totally dispassionate and centered. 

When you allow room for mistakes, you can be both authoritative and sweet. That is how the Divine is, the right balance of both. Krishna and Jesus had both. People, when they are in love, exercise authority with each other. Authority and love exist in all relationships.

 

Abhay says, "The husband just loves and the wife has authority."

Mikey asks, "Is that a mistake?"

The Great Pleasure of Rest

There is a pleasure in rest and there is a pleasure in activity. The pleasure in activity is momentary and causes fatigue. The pleasure in rest is magnanimous and energizing. So, to the one who has tasted pleasure in rest (Samadhi), the pleasure in activity is insignificant. All activities that you do, you do so that you can have deep rest. Activity is part of the system. However, the real pleasure is in Samadhi. In order to have deep rest, one must be active. The proper balance of both is essential. Many seek pleasure in this or that but the wise man just smiles. The real rest is only in knowledge.

WORRY AND FEELINGS

The head worries and the heart feels.  They cannot function at the same time.

When your feelings dominate, worry dissolves.

If you worry a lot, your feelings are dead; you are stuck in the head. Worrying makes your mind and heart inert and dull. Worries are like a rock in the head. Worry entangles you.  Worry puts you in a cage.

When you feel, you do not worry.

Feelings are like flowers, they come up, they blossom and they die. Feelings rise, they fall and then disappear. When feelings are expressed, you feel relieved. When you are angry, you express your anger and the next moment you are all right.  Or you are upset, you cry and you get over it.

Feelings last for some short time and then they drop, but worry eats at you for a longer period of time, and eventually eats you up.

Feelings make you spontaneous.  Children feel, so they are spontaneous. Adults put brakes on their feelings and they start worrying.  Worrying about anything obstructs action while feelings propel action.  Worrying about negative feelings is a blessing because it puts the brakes on those feelings, preventing you from acting on them.  Usually one never worries about positive feelings.  Worries are uncertain.  Worrying takes away your energy; you cannot think clearly when you worry.

Offering your worries is prayer and prayer moves you in feelings.

When you think you are feeling too much then you start worrying about your feelings.  Let’s not worry about it and feel our food!

God created man and the whole world with so many varieties, so many good things. God made so many types of vegetables, fragrances, flowers and thorns, dragons and horror, to please man and keep him entertained. But man got more and more depressed.

God then acted tough and man had to start pleasing Him. And so, man kept himself busy pleasing God and he became happier since he had no time to get worried or depressed.

So, when you have someone to please, it keeps you on your toes and you feel happier. But if your whole aim is just to please yourself, you will get depressed.

Pleasure simply brings more craving. But the problem is that we try to get contentment through pleasure. True contentment can only come through service.

People from 29 countries are gathered in the German Ashram for an enlightening Advanced Course.

GURU IN TWO PERSPECTIVES

In the Orient, having a master is considered a matter of pride. A master is a symbol of security, love and a sign of great wealth. Being with the guru is like being with one’s higher self. Not having a master was looked down upon as being an orphan, being poor and a sign of misfortune. The word "anatha" in Sanskrit, means one without a master. Those without a master were considered to be orphans, but not those without parents.

But in the Occident, having a master is considered a matter of shame and a sign of weakness, for masters are known for enslaving people.

In the Orient people take pride in having a guru and there is a guru for every discipline – a religious guru (dharma), a family guru (kula), a rajguru (guru for the kingdom), a vidyaguru (guru for a particular discipline) and a satguru (spiritual guru).

In the Orient, masters made you feel powerful; in the Occident, masters made you weak.

In the Orient, there was a deep sense of belongingness that would enable one to dissolve the limited identity into infinity. But in the Occident, a master was a motivator and one who provoked competition.

LOVE AND AUTHORITY

Love and authority are totally opposite values yet they co-exist.

The grosser the consciousness, authority has to be more pronounced. The more refined and subtle the consciousness, lesser is the need to exercise authority.

When you are gross, you demand authority and when you demand authority, love recedes. Asserting authority indicates lack of confidence and love. The more evident one’s authority, the less sensitive and effective it will be.

A sensible person would not demand authority at all... but will assume it. (laughter) The most effective CEOs will not make you feel their authority, for authority can never bring inspiration.

Your sincere servant has more authority over you than your boss, isn't that so? A baby has full authority over the mother.  Similarly, a devotee has all the authority over the Divine, though he never exercises it.

So, the subtler you become, the more authority you gain.

The greater the love, subtler will be the authority.

The lesser the love, the more pronounced will be the authority.

GANESHA

The lord of the diverse universe is called Ganesh.

The whole universe is nothing but groups of atoms, groups of quality, of energy. Gana means group and a group cannot exist without a lord. Like the queen bee whose mere existence brings forth the honeycomb, this diverse universe in itself is enough evidence for Ganesha's presence.

 

This Ganesha, or the lord, was born from the unmanifest transcendental consciousness, the Self, called Shiva.

Just as when atoms get bonded, matter comes into existence; when all the fragmented aspects of the human consciousness get bonded, Divine happens effortlessly and that is the birth of Ganesha from Shiva.

 

News Flash:

Ganesh Festival was celebrated in the Ashram.

The Ashram school has been accredited as the best school in Bangalore because for the third time in a row the school declared 100% results. Being a first generation school (i.e. the children are the first generation in their family to get education) this feat is truly remarkable!

Hungry for Power

Why are people hungry for power?

People are hungry for power because they want attention and recognition.

Power is a means, just like money. Passion is for an end. People who do not see power or money as a means, but see it as an end in itself, they do not live, they simply exist.

If you do not realize that you are THE power -- that is to say that you are enlightened, then you crave for power.

You crave for attention and recognition if:

You don’t have any talents,
You have no love or passion,
You are not innocent and childlike.
If you don’t have any talent and you are not contributing anything substantial to society, like an artist or a scientist, or an Art of Living teacher or volunteer, then you are hungry for power.

If you don’t have love or passion to bring about transformation in the society, then you are hungry for power.

If you are not innocent and childlike and don’t have a sense of belongingness with the whole world, then you are hungry for power.

Those who do not have any of these four, like some politicians, crave for power.

The true power is the power of the spirit; real confidence, strength and happiness all spring from the spirit. And one who knows this and has this is not hungry for power at all.

YOU AND OWNERSHIP

Man has a tendency to own things. When he owns something small his mind stays small, his life gets stifled and his whole consciousness is immersed in his house, car, spouse, children and such. A recluse leaves his home and goes far away. There also he starts owning his asana, rosary, books, concepts and his knowledge.

The owning has simply shifted from objects and people to ideas and practices. But a wise one knows that he owns the sun, the moon, the stars, the air, all of space and the Divine in its entirety. When you own something big then your consciousness also expands, and when you own something small then all the small negative emotions start coming up such as anger, greed, etc.

I wonder why people do not feel connected to the sun? The very existence of life depends upon the sun. Perhaps it is the lack of awareness that one refuses to acknowledge and own one’s connectedness to the macro-cosmic universe. The Rishis in ancient India, the Native Americans and the aboriginals from all over the globe have insisted that you can feel connection to the sun, moon and the directions.

When you own something magnanimous your consciousness also becomes magnanimous.

(Next week’s Knowledge will be on REVERENCE AND OWNERSHIP.)

REVERENCE AND OWNERSHIP

Often you do not have reverence for that which you own.

Whatever you revere becomes bigger than you.

When you have reverence in all your relationships then your own consciousness expands. Then even small things appear to be significant and big. Every little creature appears to be dignified.

It is the reverence in every relationship that saves the relationship. Often you lose reverence for that which you own, and this happens unconsciously.

When you have reverence for the whole universe, you are in harmony with the while universe. Then, you do not need to reject or renounce anything of this universe.

Reverence in ownership frees you from greed, jealousy and lust. Cultivate the skill of having reverence every moment in your life.

Enroute to Himachal Pradesh, the hill state of India, Guruji had a lively satsang in Delhi. Guruji was accorded a red carpet welcome as the State Guest of Himachal Pradesh at Kalka. After brief satsangs in Purwanoo and Solan, Guruji arrived at Simla, a famous hill station, to a moving traditional welcome with horns, music and dances. At Simla, Guruji addressed the senior bureaucrats of the state government at the state guest house. On the following day was a Maha Kriya and a big satsang attended by thousands.

Onward to Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of India, where Guruji was again invited as a state guest to the state capital Lucknow. He was received there by an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand. His address to the prominent people of Lucknow was laced with wit and humor. Guruji gifted cycles, wheel-chairs and hearing aids to 500 physically-challenged. Several thousand were blissed out in the evening satsang.

Guruji returned to Delhi for yet another blissful satsang with thousands of devotees. Also on the agenda was an inspiring address to over 5,000 village youth at a conference attended by Ms. Uma Bharati, Minister for Youth in India.

It was a whirlwind tour, and it was as if an Art of Living wave swept across all the cities that Guruji visited!

WAR: WORST ACT OF REASON

Worst Act of Reason is War.

Every war has a reason, and the reason justifies the war. Those who engage in war, reason it out. But reason is limited. As reason changes, justification falls apart.

All the reasons for every war appear to be justifiable to some limited minds and for limited time. Hence, war becomes inevitable on this planet.

War is limited to human beings. No other species in creation engage in war or mass destruction, as they have no reason. Animals have their prey and let everything just be. But mankind, from time immemorial, has been engaging in war because Man lives on reason. Man gives reason to every act of his and justifies it. As reasons change, his justifications fall apart.

Man has to transcend reason, and only then can he realize the Divinity. Then he does not engage in war. Only when people become sensible, rise above hatred and have heightened consciousness can the war be stopped.

Guruji arrived in Shillong to a tumultuous welcome by the Governor and the Chief Minister. For the first time ever, Shillong witnessed such huge gatherings as the Satsang found thousands rapt in meditation and high in spirit.

In this week alone…

Guruji was the state guest of four different Indian states – Meghalaya, Assam, West Bengal and Tripura! Estimated crowds of over 250,000 people have taken darshan and blessings of Guruji! Estimated crowds of over 35,000 people have done Sudarshan Kriya with Guruji!

At Calcutta, Guruji addressed delegates of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The evening Satsang had 30,000 people rapt in meditation and blissfully singing bhajans. Memorable yagnyas were performed at Calcutta and Guwahati for harmony in the world.

Guwahati welcomed Guruji with beautiful Assamese Bihu songs and dance sequences. Guruji emphasized the need to protect the rich and diverse Assamese culture. Thousands braved the rains to be in the evening Satsang. Guruji inaugurated the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir (school) at Guwahati by ringing the bell. After a cruise on the river Brahmaputra, the entourage left for Siliguri for less than a 24-hour stay!

Siliguri, a town in the foothill of the Darjeeling, (close to Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim), celebrated His arrival with all roads leading to the Mega Satsang. Guruji’s entourage had no risk of getting lost, as any resident of the town could guide them to Guruji’s place of residence and Satsang! The Maha Kriya in the morning had thousands doing the Sudarshan Kriya with Guruji, while the Mega Satsang had over 50,000 people singing, dancing and celebrating the grace of Guruji. At Siliguri, Guruji graced the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir and inaugurated the Rural Training Centre in the Siliguri Ashram premises. The entourage is now headed to Agartala for the last leg of Guruji’s tour of the North East.

TERRORISM: THE CAUSE AND THE REMEDY

The act which is only destructive and inflicts suffering both on oneself and others is terrorism. In such an act, human values are lost in the process of achieving a goal.

Some of the factors that lead to terrorism are:

Frustration and desperation to achieve a goal
Confused emotion
Shortsightedness and Impulsive action
Belief in a non-verifiable concept of heaven and merit; a childish concept of God favoring some and angry at others, thereby undermining the omniscience and omnipotence of the Divine.
Terrorism induces fear psychosis in all, increases poverty, suffering and loss of life with no apparent gains. Instead of solutions the terrorist looks for destruction as an answer. If you simply criticize without giving a solution, know that this criticism comes from the same seed as terrorism!

Although there are certain qualities you can appreciate in a terrorist such as:

Fearlessness
Commitment to a goal
Sacrifice
You will have to learn from them things that you should never do:

Valuing some ideas and concepts more than life.
Having a narrow perspective of life and dishonoring its diversity.
The Remedy for terrorism is:

Inculcate a broader perspective of life -- value life more than race, religion and nationality.
Educate people in human values – friendliness, compassion, cooperation and upliftment.
Teach methods to release stress and tension.
Cultivate confidence in achieving noble aims by peaceful and nonviolent means.
Create spiritual upliftment which can weed out destructive tendencies.
Question: Can it be that terrorism need not be only physical violence, but also cultural or economical?

Sri Sri: Yes.

Solution for economic violence – "Think globally, buy locally."

Solution for cultural violence – "Broaden your vision, deepen your roots."

Question: How does one cope with the aftermath of terrorism?

Sri Sri: Faith and prayer. When disaster happens, anger is inevitable. To take precautions that one does not react wisdom is needed, not emotional outbursts. One mistake cannot be corrected by another mistake. Strive for multi-cultural and multi-religious education and spiritual upliftment to reach every part pf the globe. For the world will not be safe even if a small pocket of people are left ignorant.

News Flash:

A record crowd, the likes of which have never before seen in the state, listened in rapt attention to Guruji at the satsang in Tripura, a state in the remote north eastern region of India. Our school was opened in a part of the royal palace in Agartala - the symbol of the rich cultural heritage of the state. The Governor of the state and many dignitaries attended the inauguration ceremony. Leaders of various communities as well as government and non-governmental organizations came to pay their respects to Guruji. Guruji promised them that more schools would be started in the remote regions of the state.

Satsangs and counseling to help reduce stress and post-traumatic syndromes have been set up. Our senior teachers are busy in New York.

Scientists who are engaged in research on SK are thrilled at new possibilities. Their papers will be published shortly.

HOW TO DEAL WITH ANXIETY

Today many are anxious about how to deal with their anxiety!

Here are some of the ways you can manage your anxiety:

1. Sing, dance and celebrate. The very intention to celebrate will pull you away from anxiety to a more harmonious state.

2. Think about what you can do for others rather than just about yourself. Energize yourself with some service activity.

3. Combined practice of yoga, breathing and meditation.

4. Know the impermanence of the world.

5. Having faith and surrendering to the Divine and knowing that there is a supreme power who loves you. The supreme power is behind you and accepts you totally. The sense of security comes with the sense of belongingness.

6. Valour/courage: Invoking the lion within you and having an attitude of sacrifice will rescue you from anxiety.

7. Reminding yourself that you are committed to a greater goal will keep the anxiety away.

8. Being unpredictable for a while. Anxiety is always related to some anticipated action. Do something completely irrelevant and unpredictable.

9. Readiness to face the worst will leave you with stability in the mind.

10. Remembering a similar situation in the past when you were able to overcome your anxiety.

Chanakya : If none of theses work just come and be in the presence of the Master. (laughter)

IS WAR VIOLENCE OR NON-VIOLENCE?

Violence and non-violence do not depend on the act but on the intention behind it. The basis of violence is anger, lust, hatred, jealousy, greed, frustration or aggression.

A surgeon cuts open a person's belly; so does a criminal. The action is similar. But the surgeon's intention is to save and the criminal's is to destroy.

Violence or non-violence is determined by the attitude and not the act.

Even a war can be non-violent if it is devoid of anger, hatred, jealousy or greed and it is for educating someone who cannot be educated in any other way.

Even charity can be an act of violence if it takes away self-esteem and inflicts slavery, and a war can be an act of compassion if it helps to put things in the right perspective.

Strange but True!

Drop Your Intentions

A strong tendency to keep doing something, whether important or unimportant, becomes an impediment to meditation. Doing starts first with an intention and then translates into action. Though intention springs from the Being, when it becomes doing it doesn’t let you settle down. All intentions, good or bad, trivial or important, need to be dropped for meditation to happen.

Vijay: But isn’t dropping all intentions itself an intention?

Sri Sri: Yes, but that intention is the last and necessary intention. Dropping the intentions is not an act – just the intention to drop the intentions itself serves the purpose. Dropping all intentions even for a moment brings you in touch with your Self – that instant meditation happens.

While you sit for meditation you have to let the world be the way it is. The repetition of meditation is to habituate our system to be able to stop and start activity at will. The ability to do this consciously is a very precious skill.

New Flash:

Navaratri saw unmitigated joy with devotees from all over the world. Guruji emerged from silence more even radiant, more profound. Many saints visited the ashram during the Poojas.

Aishwarya and Madhury


In the world, usually where there is Aishwarya (Lordship), there is no Madhurya (Sweetness) and where there is Madhurya, there is no Aishwarya.

Where life has blossomed fully, there is both Aishwarya and Madhurya.

Aishwarya means Ishwaratva – Lordship of that which IS. Wealth, too, is referred to as Aishwarya because wealth does command a certain amount of authority.

Can love and authority co-exist?

Only in a fully blossomed Being, there is both Lordship and Sweetness.

There was Aishwarya in Sri Rama, but only glimpses of Madhurya.

Parshuram’s life shows only Lordship, but no Madhurya.

Buddha manifested more of Madhurya – the sweetness, and less of authority.

But Krishna manifested both Aishwarya and Madhurya. So did Jesus.

There is Lordship when they said, "I am the way!"

And there is Sweetness in their expression of Prayer and Love.

Volunteer

Who is a volunteer? One who comes to help, without being asked to help; one who is self-motivated, inspired, becomes a volunteer.

There is the possibility of the inspirational motivation going down in a volunteer, which could bring frustration.

Usually volunteers come from the space of demand rather than humility – this dilutes the quality.

Another slack that could happen to a volunteer is that they could slip away from commitment, thinking there is no ‘boss’ – "If I like it, I do it; if I don’t like it, I don’t!" It is like the steering wheel of a car – if all the tires say they do not need steering, then the car cannot run smoothly. If you want to construct a building, you have to accept the authority of the structural engineer.

All these can only be overcome by being more grounded in spiritual knowledge. A volunteer devoid of spiritual dimension is utterly weak.

1) A volunteer needs to stick to his commitment.
2) The integrity in a volunteer comes from spiritual practices.
3) The authority needs to be acknowledged.
4) The strength of a volunteer comes from the challenges he is ready to willingly face.
5) A volunteer moves beyond boundaries as he finds he is capable of doing so many things he never ever thought of doing.
6) A true volunteer does not expect appreciation or reward.
7) A volunteer has such a joy – that joy, itself, comes as the reward.
8) If a volunteer thinks he is obliging somebody, he is thoroughly mistaken. He is ‘volunteering’ because he derives so much joy out of it.

The joy is immediate – it does not come on the first of every month in the form of a salary!

When a volunteer realizes this, he is filled with gratitude.

When a volunteer waivers from within, the support system is knowledge and good friends.

News Flash:

In Delhi, Guruji addressed the UN conference on Volunteerism. Then on to Hong Kong, where He gave an inspiring talk at a beautiful satsang in the packed Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton Hotel.

Adulation

Adulation shows the magnanimity of the one who adores, rather than the one who is adored!
Adulation indicates that the ego has become transparent;
the best antidote for ego is adulation.

Adulation works in three ways:
If it is for someone else, it is not palatable to an egoistic person.
If it is for you, it boosts your ego.
If you adore somebody, it dissolves your ego and makes you magnanimous.

Unanimous chorus : When Guruji is adulated, E V E R Y O N E adores it! (laughter)

Adulation indicates the magnanimity of the person who is adoring. And the one who is great, does not get swayed by adulation. So the test of the greatness of a person is that he is not shaken by any amount of adulation.

A desire for adulation is a sign of immaturity.
Aversion to adulation is small-mindedness.
Lack of adulation in life is dryness and boredom.

A healthy mind would always like to adulate, to elevate others.
An unhealthy mind would like to pull down everything.

Adulation indicates the trust, enthusiasm and richness in a culture.
Lack of adulation is a self-centred, small-minded, fearful and culturally-impoverished society.

Being indifferent to adulation when it comes to you and being magnanimous when it is to be given, is the way of the wise!

Seva

There are five types of seva.

The first type of seva is when you do not even know that you are doing seva. You do not recognize it as seva because it is your very nature - you cannot but do it!

The second type of seva is what you do because it is needed in that situation.

You do the third type of seva because it gives you joy.

The fourth type is done out of your desire for merit - you do seva expecting some benefit in the future.

And the fifth type is when you do seva just to show off, to improve your image and to gain social or political recognition. Such seva is simply exhausting, while the first type does not bring any tiredness at all!

To improve the quality of your seva, regardless of where you start, you must move up to higher levels of seva.

Confidence with Humility: The Rarest Combination

One of the rarest combinations in the human personality is the co-existence of confidence and humility. Often people who are confident are not humble and people with humility are not confident.

Confidence blended with humility is most appreciated by everybody.

Question: How can confidence be developed in one who is humble and humility in one who is confident?

Sri Sri:

When you see your life from a bigger context of time and space, then you realize your life is nothing.
When you are humble you need to see that you are unique and dear to the Divine, which brings confidence, and when you realize you are insignificant, that brings confidence.
When you have a guru, you cannot be arrogant. Your guru gives you confidence and also brings humility in you. The weakness in humility and the arrogance in confidence are removed.
You are left with confidence and humility!

Dreaming the Impossible

Question: Guruji, how can we control daydreams?

Sri Sri: Dream in the night! (laughter)

What is daydreaming? You have a desire but you do not have the faith that you can achieve your desire - that is what you call daydreaming.

You can control daydreaming by having a strong goal and believing in it.

Like the scientist who wanted to go to the moon and kept dreaming about it - for him it was the goal of his life but for others it was daydreaming.

Either you drop that it will not happen or you believe!

When you do not know yourself, your potentiality, you have no faith and confidence in your dream.

Once you have faith and confidence in your dream, it is no longer a daydream!

The confidence and commitment of the Yuvacharyas held everyone spellbound as they recounted success tales of alcohol-free, tobacco-free villages, and where love and belongingness are being nurtured. Immense numbers of legal cases have been withdrawn from courts, with warring factions agreeing to peaceful settlements, especially those involving "under-privileged" classes. Homes are being given to the needy, Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandirs opened where schools are not available.

Respect and Ego

There are two types of respect.

1. Respect that comes to you because of your position, fame or wealth. This type of respect is impermanent. It can be lost once you lose your wealth or status.

2. Respect that comes because of your virtues like honesty, kindness, commitment, patience and your smile. This respect, no one can take away.

The less you are attached to your virtues, the more self respect you have. If you get attached to your virtues, you look down upon everybody else and they (the virtues) start diminishing. Non- attachment to virtues brings the highest self respect.

Often one confuses ego with self esteem. Ego needs the other for comparision, self esteem is just confidence in oneself. For example, a gentleman claims that he is thorough in Mathematics or Geography, this is self esteem. But to say that I know better than you, that is Ego.

Ego simply means lack of respect to the Self.

Ego upsets you very often. Self esteem is immune to getting upset by external factors. In self respect, everything is a game, winning or losing has no meaning, every step is joy, every move is celebration.

In Self esteem you simply realise you have it.

This time all roads did not lead to Rome, but to Florence, where people from all over Italy flocked to meet Guruji. The President of Tuscany who has also done the Art of Living Basic and Advanced courses, organised the program. Then Guruji arrived in Lithuania to inspire the assembly of East European teachers and an advanced course.

On His return to Bangalore, Guruji blessed 35 yuvacharyas (youth leaders) who graduated on Sunday and will be covering 236 villages spanning 4 districts under the aegis of the 5H program.

MAYA

 What is Maya?

Maya is that which can be measured. The whole world can be measured, that is why it is Maya. All the five elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether - can be measured.

Question: Can space be measured?

Sri Sri: Only in space can things be measured. Space is the first dimension of measurement.

Measurement is always relative and not absolute. Example: If something weighs 6 kilos on the earth, it then weighs only 1 kilo on the moon. The light of the star you see today is not really today's light. It has taken at least 4 years for the light to reach you! Both size and weight change in air, water and earth. So "measure" is illusive and not dependable. Your bones, skin, body, environment and five elements can be measured; you can put a value to it. So, the whole world is Maya!

All measures are relative understanding. Einstein's theory of relativity correlates with the Advaita (non-dual) philosophy.

 But what is not Maya? All that cannot be measured is not Maya. You cannot say 1 ounce of love, 2 ounces of peace, 5 kilos of happiness, Can YOU be measured? It is not possible. Your body has weight, but not YOU. Truth cannot be measured, Ananda (joy) cannot be measured, beauty cannot be measured. All these are part of Consciousness or Easwara (Divine) and are called MAYI.

Letting Go of Control

Many have a problem of letting go of control. This results in anxiety, restlessness and it sours relationships.

Wake up and see, are you really in control? What are you in control of? Perhaps a tiny part of your waking state! Isn’t that so?

You are not in control when you are sleeping or dreaming.
You are not in control of thoughts and emotions coming to you. You may choose to express it or not, but they come to you without your prior permission!
You realize that most of the functions of your body are not in your control, and the same for your life and the whole universe.
Similarly, do you think you are in control of all the events in your life or in the world? That is a joke!

When you look at things from this angle you need not be afraid of losing control, because you have none!

Whether you realise it or not, when you let go of your sense of control that is when you truly relax. Your identification of being somebody does not let you relax totally and it keeps your domain limited.

The highlights of Guruji’s Chennai visit were Maha Satsang, Maha Kriya, Rudra Pooja, free medical camps, and more.

Memory -- A Hindrance and a Blessing

The forgetfulness in the nature of man is the root cause of all problems and suffering in life. The very remembrance of one’s nature, which is godliness, brings freedom in life. Here, memory is your best friend. The purpose of knowledge is to remind you of your true nature. In the Bhagvad Gita, Arjuna said to Krishna, "I got back my memory. Now I have realized and will do as you say."

Memory is a blessing and your best friend when it comes to your true nature. Memory is a hindrance when it does not let you be free of events, pleasant or unpleasant.

Pleasant events create cravings and competition in the mind and do not allow fresh experiences, whereas unpleasant events give a biased perception and create paranoia. So the memory is both a blessing and a hindrance depending on whether you remember your nature or you are stuck with events in time and space.

 2001 was given a fond farewell with an international feast. Also, the Ashram witnessed a cultural evening filled with music and dances from several countries represented there. The New Year was welcomed with silence and beautiful meditation with Guruji.

Don't Be Perturbed by Foolishness

What really perturbs you? Isn’t it the foolishness that goes on around you?

It is foolish to be perturbed by the foolishness. Foolishness cannot overpower or annihilate wisdom nor does the foolishness stay all the time. When you are not well-founded in wisdom, then foolishness perturbs you, throws you out of balance. When you create space for foolishness you do not get perturbed by it, rather you will laugh and move on. Otherwise you hate, get angry or become stressed by foolish acts.

When you know that truth is eternal and invincible you take foolishness as a joke and remain unmoved by it. Those who are averse to foolishness or get irritated by it are members of the fools club.

Beware! Do not sign up.

Glory (Vaibhav) and Dispassion (Vairag)

It is often believed that glory and dispassion are contradictory and cannot co-exist. Glory and luxury without dispassion is a nauseating pomp and show. Such glory does not bring fulfillment for anyone… it is shallow. Alternately, the dispassion that is afraid of glory is weak. True dispassion is oblivious to glory.

The glory that comes with dispassion is something that is true, that is permanent and authentic. When someone runs after glory they are shallow. Like movie stars, politicians and religious leaders who try to hold on to their status, to their glory, they are certain to lose. If you run after glory all you get is misery. When you are dispassionate, glory comes to you.

If you are afraid of glory, that means you are not well-founded in dispassion. In India, the Sadhus run away from glory. They think they will lose their dispassion and get trapped in the web of the world, the circus. The dispassion is so blissful, they get attached to the dispassion. (laughter)

They are afraid of losing the dispassion, the centeredness and bliss that comes along with it. This is weak dispassion. Dispassion is a state of being and glory is the happening around it. True dispassion can never be lost or overshadowed by glory.

True dispassion is glorious!

Real glory is true dispassion!

News Flash:

Colorado Springs and Boulder witnessed overflowing halls of joy for Guruji’s public talks. The students and faculty of Naropa University were ecstatic and inspired finding Guruji in their midst.

Where Dispassion is Detrimental!

Karthik: Is there something we should not be dispassionate about?

Guruji: Myself! (laughter)

Do not put off the fire of longing for the Divine or Satsang with Dispassion.

There is a little fire in you that propels you towards Knowledge, Sadhana, Devotion and Service. Sometimes you use Knowledge to put off that fire. The so-called dispassionate people are often morose and unenthusiastic. Many a times you hear people saying. " Oh, never mind, God is everywhere, Guruji is in my heart, you can do satsang anywhere. My Seva is my Sadhana, so no need to meditate, anyway I am doing Sadhana twenty-four hours. When God wills, he will call me to satsang and advanced courses again!"

Such excuses should not be justified as dispassion.

When you want to do some service, the mind goes, "Oh, its all Maya, anyway everything is an illusion. It’s all just happening. Things will happen when the time comes!"

In this way Knowledge gets misused and is quoted out of context to suit one’s convenience or laziness. In the name of dispassion do not lose that spark of enthusiasm and interest. Using Knowledge like this you miss out a lot.

Keep the fire of longing for the Divine and service to the society alive. Dispassion here would be detrimental.

Business and Spirituality

Often business is looked down upon by spiritualists and spirituality is put off as non-practical by businessmen. Spirituality is the heart, business is the legs, and that is what the ancient people conceived. An individual or a society is incomplete without both these aspects. Business brings material comfort and spirituality brings mental and emotional comfort. Spirituality brings ethics and fair practice to business. In the body/mind complex depriving any one comfort means depriving both the comforts. You cannot talk spirituality to the poorest of the poor people without taking care of their basic needs. They need to be supported materially. There is no spirituality in the world that is devoid of service and service cannot happen if material needs are ignored. Service cannot happen only through the lips. For service to move you need legs.

Every system has its flaws. As capitalism exploits the poor, socialism dampens individual creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. Spirituality is the bridge between socialism and capitalism. Spirituality gives the heart to serve to the capitalists and the spirit to innovate to the socialist.

The Subtle Truth About Virtues

If we observe our behavior, we procrastinate doing something good but we are in a hurry when it comes to doing something bad. For example if we are angry we want to express it immediately and not wait.

Do you know WHY? Because virtues are your very nature and they will never leave you. Your vices are not your nature and they will leave you. The negative tendencies are transient and they will leave you if you do not act on them. Frustration, crying cannot stay for long, at least with the same intensity. Perhaps we are concerned that the vices will leave us if we do not act on them.

It is only wise to postpone the vices for they will not stay and act immediately for doing good, otherwise we will keep postponing the good for the next few lifetimes. (Laughter!!!)

There was an attempt during the World Economic Forum to divide the religious communities into monotheistic or polytheistic. This was given up at Guruji’s insistence and harmony finally prevailed.

Humor and Humiliation

Humor is the buffer that saves you from humiliation. If you have a good sense of humor you can never be humiliated. And if you refuse to be humiliated you become invincible. Humor brings everyone together, while humiliation tears them apart. In a society torn with humiliation and insult, humor is like a breath of fresh air. A good sense of humor relieves you from fear and anxiety.

Humor should be coupled with care and concern. Mere humor without care and concern or appropriate action often irritates those who come to you with serious problems.

Humor can keep the spirit high, yet if overdone it leaves a bad taste.
Humor without wisdom is shallow.
Humor with wisdom creates an atmosphere of celebration.
Humor without sensitivity is satire - it comes back to you with more problems.

The wise use humor to bring wisdom and to lighten every situation.
The intelligent use humor as a shield against humiliation.
The cruel use humor as a sword to insult others.
The irresponsible use humor to escape from responsibility.
And fools take humor too seriously!
To make an effort to be humorous is nonsensical.

Question: How does one cultivate a sense of humor?

Sri Sri:

Humor is not just words, it is the lightness of your Being. You do not have to read and repeat jokes -- just being cordial and light-hearted brings out authentic humor.
Taking life itself not too seriously (because you will never come out of it alive!) (Laughter)
Having a sense of belongingness with everybody, including those who are not friendly
Practicing yoga and meditation
Having unshakable faith in the Divine, and in the laws of karma
Being in the company of those who live in knowledge and are humorous
A willingness to be a clown

Love and Truth

Why would someone tell a lie to their close ones or to their beloved?

This is a question most often asked by lovers. Since love cannot stand untruth, this causes relationships to break up. The solution lies in understanding the paradox of love and truth.

 People tell lies just to save and maintain their love. The fear that the truth might damage their love causes lies to be told between husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, parents and children and in family situations.

In love you feel weak and truth brings strength. Yet why do people prefer love over truth, i.e. weakness over strength?! (laughter)

 No one wants to sacrifice love. Thus people are ready to give up the truth for their love. Love takes the luster out of truth. Sometimes truth can make love bitter while in love even lies can appear sweet, like Krishna’s lies to his mother Yashoda!

The truth that does not nourish love has no sense and the love that cannot withstand the truth is not true love. When one is assured that the love is so strong that the truth can neither break it nor cause bitterness, then the truth prevails and love shines.

Truth has judgments, but true love is beyond judgments. Thus true love makes you weak and yet it is the greatest strength.

News Flash:

Bliss reigned supreme in the beautiful South Indian state of Kerala. Over a million hearts were stolen by Sri Sri during His tour of Kerala. Everywhere He went, the script was the same – overflowing stadiums, inspiring and scintillating discourses, deep meditations, tears of gratitude. No one could escape! All the events were highlighted in the media.

The Chief Minister of Kerala State and most of his cabinet ministers hosted Sri Sri at a special function and sought His advice on problems that they were facing.

An Awkward Situation

Why do you feel awkward? And how do you get out of it?

If you have always been the center of attention, and are suddenly sidelined, you may feel out of place. Similarly if you have always been on the side lines, and are suddenly pushed to center stage, you may experience restlessness.
If you are used to ordering, and suddenly have to take orders, or, if you usually follow orders, and you are made to give them, you may feel out of place.
A very busy person with nothing to do, or a laid back person who is faced with a lot of responsibilities may experience restlessness.

Very often, feeling out of place blocks the reason and distorts the logic.

If the situation you are in is inevitable, tolerate it.
If it’s avoidable, walk out of it.

If you feel that it can expand your abilities, smile through it.

Every awkward situation increases your comfort zone.
Every awkward situation is a test for how deep you are in the Knowledge.

Love something of an awkward situation. This will increase your comfort zone.
When your comfort zone increases, no one will be able to push your buttons and you will become so centered and unshakable.

The Hathwa Palace brimming over with people, rapturously welcomed Guruji. Evening Satsang was at the Beur Jail where the prisoners had a heart-to-heart chat with Guruji.

Later, hundreds of students had the benefit of an exclusive session with Him. The Maha Satsang saw over a hundred and fifty thousand people, experiencing His electrifying Presence.

The next morning Gurudev left for the village, Massauri, which has been the target of numerous terrorist attacks. Thousands who have benefitted from Navchetna Shibirs (Breath Water Sound Workshops) had been preparing for weeks for His visit. Most villagers shared that it was impossible to leave their homes after dusk because of the very volatile and dangerous situation there, but the Shivirs and Satsangs had transformed their lives.

 

Following the Gujarat tragedy, Guruji has requested that everyone observe 2 minutes of silence on Wednesday the 6th of March 2002, at 9:00 AM local time through out the world for communal peace and harmony and to pay respect to those who have been victims of religious intolerance.

The True Yagya

Rage has no ears, nor does it have vision.

It only leads to reaction.

And reaction leads to regret.

Regret causes frustration.

Frustration clouds the reason.

Unreasonable acts provoke rage, and start a vicious cycle.

Self Knowledge and Devotion alone can free you from this vicious cycle.

In the fire of Knowledge, when rage and revenge are offered, the warmth of the blemishless Self shines forth.

This is the true Yagya.

Guruji was exceptionally busy this week, meeting various leaders of the Muslim and Hindu communities late into the night to bring peace and harmony and a resolution of the Ayodhya issue. He convinced both the Muslim personal law board and the VHP to come on to the negotiating table.

There were remarkably interesting sessions on the AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) symposium on the Science of Breath, some of which Guruji Himself chaired. An international team of doctors presented their research findings to more than 1000 delegates. Synopsis and videos will be made available by May.

Guruji also went to an impromptu Satsang which was organized for Him at Tihar Jail. More than 4000 inmates who had already done the Prison SMART program greeted Him enthusiastically and He went among them and showered flowers of Grace on them.

He noticed that there were some very old women prisoners there, who could barely sit or stand by themselves, utterly incapable of committing any crimes, and He has made an appeal to the Governor to grant them amnesty.

He is now in Rishikesh …..

Praise the Fools!

Praising the fool is beneficial for society!

A fool when pleased might stop doing harm and start doing good work. In this sense it is wise to praise a fool as he needs motivation. So your praise is meaningful when it is directed towards a fool!

A wise man by his very nature will keep doing good work. His attitude does not depend on someone’s praise or blame. So it does not serve any purpose to praise a wise man because your praise cannot make an impact on him.

There are three types of people – the wise, the crooked and the immature.
Even if the wise man is scolded or praised, he continues doing good work.
The crooked need to be praised to do good work.
The immature however need to be both praised and scolded from time to time.

A close associate of Osama Bin Laden, Mohammad Afroz, who is currently in the high security Bombay prison, was involved in the plan to blow up the London airport. He took the Prison SMART and was totally transformed. He wrote that he wished that all the Al Qaeda members would do the course which brought forth such a transformation in him. His desire is to become a teacher of AOL and bring peace and harmony to people!

At the same time Reverend Shri Shiva Muniji Maharaj, the proponent of non-violence (or Ahimsa) and the head of the Jain religion, was on the advanced course and proclaimed the fulfillment of the Jain religion from what he found in the AOL.

WHAT MAKES A REAL HOLIDAY?

Rest and happiness make a real holiday. Often people go on a holiday and they come back tired and tanned, and needing a few more days to recuperate! A real holiday is that which energizes and does not wear you out.  Remember, nothing energizes you like Wisdom.

-   Doubts and complaints are impediments for rest.

-  The moment you set out on your holiday, know that it has begun.  Often people expect to find a pinnacle of happiness. Enjoy every moment of the journey as children do, do not wait for the destination.

-  If you cannot be happy in one place, you cannot be happy in any other place. If you do not know how to row one boat you will not be able to row any other boat.

-  To get maximum satisfaction out of your holiday you need to do something creative and engage in Seva.

-  Do not ever forget to make meditation and prayer a part of your holiday.

If your days are Holy, then every day is a Holiday!

Wake Up and Slow Down!

When you are in a rush, you are unable to properly perceive things. Often you are in a rush in life. This takes away the charm, thrill and beauty from your life. You can never be close to the Truth when you are in a rush because your perception, observation and expression become distorted.

The rush to enjoy robs the joy from life. All the rush that you have in your life only denies the joy and freedom of here and now.

Often one does not even know why one is in a hurry. It almost becomes a biological phenomenon to be in a rush. Wake up and become aware of the rush in you!

Anne Farrow says: Wake up and slow down! (Laughter!)

It is ridiculous to be in a rush to slow down. Just being aware of the rush itself will take care of it. Slowing down does not mean lethargy or procrastination. It is easy to be in either extreme of being in a rush or being lethargic.

Feverishness arises out of lack, a need to achieve; whereas dynamism is an expression of fulfillment.

The golden rule is to be awake, and being awake you cannot help but be dynamic.

To check the fanaticism and fundamentalism of religious communities.
To care for and share with the needy.
Only spirituality can bring fulfillment to communism.

Was Buddha an Atheist?

A pure atheist is impossible to find. An atheist is one who does not believe in anything that is not concrete and tangible. Life is not all concrete and tangible. Nor is this Universe. Whether it is business, science or art, they all involve a certain amount of guesswork, assumptions, imagination and intuition. All of them are ethereal in nature and are not tangible. The moment an atheist accepts, even remotely a field that is unexplainable, he ceases to be an atheist. Any intelligent person cannot rule out the mystery in life and the universe and hence cannot honestly be an atheist! The so-called atheists are perhaps only denouncing certain concepts of God.

Question: Was Buddha an atheist?

Sri Sri: "No" in one sense because he professed emptiness which is very hard for an atheist to accept and "Yes" in another sense because he did not profess concepts of God.

Jim: An atheist believes only what he can see but Buddha said all that you see is not real.

THE STRENGTH OF COMMITMENT

Question: Why is it easier for some of us to commit to our own welfare rather than that of others?

Sri Sri: Because you do not know that whatever you are committed to brings you strength.
If you are committed to your family then your family supports you, if you are committed to your society, you enjoy the support of society. If you are committed to God, God gives you strength. If you are committed to Truth, Truth brings you strength.

Often one is not aware of this idea and that is why one is hesitant to commit to a greater cause. Also there is a fear that commitment would weaken one or take away one's freedom. Your commitment to a cause is bound to bring you comfort in the long run.

Commitment in life grows toward a higher cause. The higher the commitment, greater is the good for all.

TWO TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE

There are two types of knowledge. The first one is pure knowledge and the second one is applied knowledge. Applied knowledge may benefit you directly and immediately but pure knowledge benefits you indirectly in the long run.

If there are some things that you have studied or understood that you are unable to put into practice, do not get disheartened. Sometime in the future, if you do not discard the knowledge you have as impractical, it will be of use to you.

Often people discard the pure knowledge for its lack of immediate application. In fact these two types of knowledge compliment each other. Applied knowledge without pure knowledge remains weak. And pure knowledge without application will remain unfulfilled.

Do not discard or label the knowledge as impractical. Do not label yourself as weak or unworthy because you are unable to apply the knowledge in your day-to-day life.

Sometimes when you are alone in nature, silent, taking a walk, looking at the sand on the beach, a bird in the sky, or while meditating – suddenly the knowledge will emerge and you will recognize the knowledge dawning in your life.

Examine your friendships, they are often for a cause. There are several reasons for your friendships:

You make friendships because you have common enemies. Fear and threat to survival can bring people together.
You make friendships because you have a common problem. You talk about your problems and become friends. For example, sickness, job dissatisfaction, etc…
People get together because they have common interests. For example, through business or a profession (doctors, architects, social workers, etc…)
You make friends because you have common tastes. You have similar tastes in sports, movies, entertainment, music, hobbies, etc…
People become friends because of compassion and service. Out of compassion and pity for someone, you become friends with them.
People become friends merely because of long-term acquaintance.
Brave are those who nurture friendships for only friendship’s sake. Such friendships will never die nor become soured for it is born out of one’s friendly nature. Only through wisdom can one become friendly by nature.

Several Types of Dispassion

There are several types of dispassion:

You are dispassionate because you realize the misery in the world. (You have a fear of misery.) The events in life -- the pain, the suffering one experiences or sees -- brings dispassion.
The second type of dispassion is born out of the desire to reach something higher. Some consider dispassion as a path to enlightenment. If you renounce something here you gain something out there. Those who are seeking enlightenment practice austerities and take vows for a better place in heaven.
The third type of dispassion comes out of wisdom or knowledge. A broader understanding of the transient nature of things brings a state of non-attachment to any events, objects, people or situations that lets you remain calm and unperturbed.
Divine love does not let the dispassion manifest. The attainment of love brings such bliss and such intoxication, it not only takes away your passion, but dispassion as well.

This is the problem with Art of Living members. Many feel they have attained the highest and remain blissed out! (laughter!)

FAITH AND ALERTNESS

Faith and alertness appear to be completely opposite in nature. When you are alert, usually there is no faith and you feel restless and insecure. When there is faith the mind is secure and rested and you are not alert.

There are three types of faith:

Tamasic faith which is because of dullness. Like when you do not want to take responsibility or action and you say, "Oh it doesn’t matter, anyway God will take care of all these things!" (laughter)

Rajasic faith which is brought on by intense compulsion of desires and ambition. The ambition keeps the faith alive.

Satvic faith is innocent and is born out of fullness of consciousness.

Faith and alertness, though apparently opposite in nature, are actually complementary to each other. In the absence of faith there can be no growth, and without alertness there can be no correct understanding. Faith can make you complacent. Alertness makes you tense.

If there is no faith, there is fear. And when there is no alertness one cannot perceive or express properly. A combination of both is essential.

In Gyana (state of wisdom) there is alertness without tension and faith without complacency. The purpose of education should be to remove the element of dullness from faith and the element of fear from alertness. This is a unique and rare combination. If you have faith and alertness at the same time, then you will become a true Gyani (the Wise One)!

ENTHUSIASM AND DISPASSION

What is enthusiasm? Enthusiasm means to be connected to God within. When you are with your source, you can only be enthusiastic. Apathy is when you are away from the source of life. You cannot be but enthusiastic when your mind is totally in the present moment.

You should know that dispassion is not apathy. It is simply a broader perspective of reality. Dispassion is moving towards the source. Dispassion simply means the way back home. It is the journey towards the source, which is a reservoir of enthusiasm.

When dispassion and enthusiasm co-exist, that is the secret of perennial enthusiasm and profound dispassion. Though they appear to be opposite, they are actually complementary.

An 11th century temple rose from ruins in Guruji’s birthplace of Thayagasamudram thanks to the sole effort of one of our Art of Living teacher, Setu Mamy. Even though about 80 years old, her enthusiasm is that of a teenager. Single-handedly she overcame all hurdles to bring this temple back to life. It was a grand celebration in the village. Guruji promised to build homes for needy people there.

GURU’S TIDBITS

1. What to do if your commitment is boring?

Commitment has value when things are not so charming. When things are interesting you do not need commitment at all. You never say you are committed to doing something that is very interesting or charming.

2. Learning is inevitable. By doing things right you learn, and by doing things wrong you also learn. From every situation, from everybody, you learn either what to do or what not to do. Either by mistakes or by doing things correctly, you cannot but learn. Learning is inevitable.

It is only when you sleep that you do not learn. And if you are asleep in your life, there is neither pain nor pleasure nor learning. Most people are in such deep slumber. That is why many people do not even make an effort to get out of pain.

3. Question: How to improve patience?

Sri Sri: Can I tell you next year? (Laughter)

4. Question: How to improve memory?

Sri Sri: Ask me this question later. (Laughter)

NIGRA, AGRA, SATYAGRA AND DURAGRA

Nigra means control.

Agra means insistence.

Satyagra means steadfast determination.

Duragra means blind adamancy, reckless stubbornness.

These four will give you progress when practiced for a limited period of time. They give limited results, positive or negative. But if they stay on for a longer period, they eat away the potential of life. One has to transcend all these four to attain peace.

Freedom is when you transcend all four. They are inevitable to streamline life but you need to transcend them to be free.

Give your own examples and discuss nigra, agra, satyagra, and duragra.

Wake up and Transcend

The foolish one uses the spiritual power to gain material comfort.

An intelligent one uses the material world to rise high in the spirit.

When you transcend the intellect you allow yourself to be used by the spirit.

One who is awake neither uses anything nor loses anything.

Become intelligent, transcend and wake up.

CREATIVITY

Creativity brings a new beginning for "time". When you are creative, you break the monotony of time. Everything becomes fresh and alive. Creativity brings along with it a new round of enthusiasm. Both creative and procreative impulses in nature are associated with enthusiasm. When you are enthusiastic you are closer to the creative principle of existence.

Deep silence is the mother of creativity. No creativity can come out of one who is too busy, worried, over-ambitious or lethargic. Balanced activity, rest and yoga can kindle skills and creativity in you.

KNOW YOUR GROUP TYPE

Normally in the world people with similar tendencies group together; intelligent people group together, fools get together, happy people get together, ambitious people get together and disgruntled people also group together to celebrate their problems! (Laughter) There is a saying, “Birds of a feather flock together.”

The disgruntled people get together, they complain and pull each other down. A frustrated person cannot be with someone happy because the other is not dancing to their tune. You only feel comfortable when the other person is in tune with you. Intelligent people do not feel at home with foolish people. Foolish people feel that intelligent ones are not humane. One with wisdom feels at home with the disgruntled as well as the happy, foolish and intelligent. Similarly, people with all these tendencies also feel at home with the wise.

Just turn around and look at what goes on in your group – are you grateful or grumbling? Take responsibility to uplift the people around you. That is Satsang, not just singing and leaving.

The wise person is like the sky where all birds can fly.

FREE WILL AND DESTINY

When people consider the past as free will they are filled with remorse and regret.

When they consider the future as destiny, lethargy and inertia set in.

A wise person will consider the past as destiny and the future as free will.

When you consider the past as destiny, no more questions are raised and the mind is at ease.

And when you consider the future as free will you are filled with enthusiasm and dynamism.

Of course there will be some uncertainty when you consider the future as free will, and some anxiety, but it can also bring alertness and creativity.

Consider the past as destiny, the future as free will and the present moment as Divinity.

Question: How do we remove the anxiety?

Answer: By having faith in the Divine and doing sadhana.

More than 100 Art of Living volunteers from seven European countries came together to help flood victims in Dresden, Germany where huge floods have destroyed all that people once had. Many volunteers worked through the night to free houses from the mud. The mayor of Pirna/Dresden and the leading military officer there have expressed their gratitude to the Art of Living volunteers.

Currently, free Art of Living Breath-Water-Sound and ART Excel courses are being conducted for the victims.

And finally, Guruji celebrated Lord Krishna's birth in Hyderabad with a grand satsang. He then proceeded to Nagpur.
