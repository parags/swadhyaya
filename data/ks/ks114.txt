Window Shutters

To the degree that you are awake, everything around you brings you knowledge. If you are not awake, then even the most precious knowledge does not make any sense.

(Suddenly there was much noise from outside and Kiran went to shut the window.)

Sri Sri: Awareness depends upon your ability to shut your windows. When there is a storm you need to shut your windows, otherwise you will get wet.

When it is hot and suffocating inside, you need to open your windows. Your senses are like the windows. When you have the ability to open and shut your windows at your will then you are free and you are awake. When your windows cannot be shut or opened, you are bound.

Attending to that is sadhana or practice.

NEWS FLASH

There was extensive media coverage about Guruji both in Copenhagen and in Stockholm. In Copenhagen, Guruji and the evening Satsang were featured in "Good Morning Denmark", a TV program which "wakes up" Danish people in the morning.

In Stockholm, far more people came for the evening program than could be accommodated. Guruji first went and greeted those who could not get into the auditorium. The last comes first!

Jai Guru Dev
