ATTACHMENTS

Attachments cause feverish breath and feverish breath takes away peace of mind. Then you are in pieces and fall prey to misery. Before you get scattered too much, gather yourself and rid your breath of the feverishness through surrender and sadhana. Unfortunately most people do not notice this until it is too late.

When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team. Without fighting the attachments, observe the feverish breath and go to the cool place of silence within. Your first step in this direction is directing your attachment to the Knowledge, to the Divine.

Your non-attachment to the mundane is your charm. Your attachment to the Divine is your beauty.

 Guruji was sitting at the airport in Perth, Western Australia when he asked Joy what she did. She said, "I am an interior decorator." He said, "Oh, we do the same job."

 

NEWS FLASH:

 Thursday being Rama's birthday, Guruji gave a talk on Rama. It was stunning. Then we went to Madras for Satsang. Many dignitaries came to take Guruji's blessing, including the ex-President of India and his family. Brilliant questions and answers provided a moving Satsang.

 Singapore snatched a Satsang on the way to Australia.

 Perth packed them in and Sydney was swirling. Two fundamentalists verbally attacked Guruji as soon as he entered the hall, shocking the audience. Unshaken, Guruji delivered a powerful and eloquent discourse.

 In Ipswich, near Brisbane, Marcy taught a course. To the amazement of all the participants, the image of an Indian Goddess appeared on the leaf of a plant.

Jai Guru Dev
