MAYA

 What is Maya?

Maya is that which can be measured. The whole world can be measured, that is why it is Maya. All the five elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether - can be measured.

Question: Can space be measured?

Sri Sri: Only in space can things be measured. Space is the first dimension of measurement.

Measurement is always relative and not absolute. Example: If something weighs 6 kilos on the earth, it then weighs only 1 kilo on the moon. The light of the star you see today is not really today's light. It has taken at least 4 years for the light to reach you! Both size and weight change in air, water and earth. So "measure" is illusive and not dependable. Your bones, skin, body, environment and five elements can be measured; you can put a value to it. So, the whole world is Maya!

All measures are relative understanding. Einstein's theory of relativity correlates with the Advaita (non-dual) philosophy.

 But what is not Maya? All that cannot be measured is not Maya. You cannot say 1 ounce of love, 2 ounces of peace, 5 kilos of happiness, Can YOU be measured? It is not possible. Your body has weight, but not YOU. Truth cannot be measured, Ananda (joy) cannot be measured, beauty cannot be measured. All these are part of Consciousness or Easwara (Divine) and are called MAYI.
