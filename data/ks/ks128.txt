EGO

When is there Ego?

1. When you don't get attention.

2. When you seem to be losing attention.

3. When you get attention (Laughter).

Ego causes heaviness, discomfort. It doesn't let love flow. Ego can be transcended by knowing the Truth; by enquiring "Who am I?" Often, your attitude towards one who has ego is of contempt or jealousy. But rather you should have compassion, or even pity, isn't it?

There is also a positive aspect of ego. It drives one to do some work. A person will do a job either out of compassion or out of ego. Most of the work in the society is by boosting the ego. But in Satsang, work is done out of love. Ego is separateness; non-belongingness. It is wanting to prove and to possess.

And when you wake up and see, there is nothing to be proved and nothing to possess, ego dissolves.

NEWS FLASH

The Satsang tour continued on to Hyderabad, where despite a cyclone warning, swarms of people came to be blessed by the Master and were surprised to hear Him speaking chaste Telugu. Many healing experiences were shared. Guruji's talk to the doctors the next day was simply stunning and as with all his best talks, it was not recorded.

Fireworks and exuberant Ashramites welcomed Guruji back to Bangalore. An Advanced Course is in progress and preparations are on for a big public Satsang in Bangalore on the 23rd.

Jai Guru Dev
