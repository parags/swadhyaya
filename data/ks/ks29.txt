DIVINE IS ALL CELEBRATION

 A poor man celebrates the new year once a year. A rich man celebrates each day. But the richest man celebrates every moment.

 How rich are you? Do you celebrate once a year? Once a month? Every day? If you celebrate every moment, you are the Lord of Creation.

 Review the year while you celebrate. This is your homework. What did you do? What did you achieve? How useful were you this past year? Sit for an hour and think about every week, one minute per week, and see the year's growth in less than an hour. With a flower, on New Year's Day, offer the whole year to the Divine.

 

 

SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE

 During Satsang, Guruji opened a small nicely-wrapped present. It was a tiny bottle of jasmine perfume. He twisted off the cap and sniffed the lovely fragrance. Then he proceeded to pour a small amount on some paper which he waved in the air, wafting the scent to all corners of the hall. Everyone could then enjoy it.

 Guruji explained that it is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it. In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance.

 Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.

 

Jai Guru Dev
