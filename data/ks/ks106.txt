SENSITIVITY AND STRENGTH

Those who are sensitive often feel weak. Those who feel strong are often insensitive.

Some people are sensitive to themselves but insensitive to others . They often feel the others are "bad guys."

Those who are sensitive to others but not to themselves often end up feeling Poor me.

Some conclude it's better not to be sensitive ,because sensitivity brings pain. They shut off .But mind you , if you are not sensitive, you will lose all the finer things in life, too--intuition, beauty and ecstasy of love.

Insensitive people usually do not recognize their weakness .And those who are sensitive do not recognize that their sensitivity is their strength .

This path and this Knowledge make you strong and sensitive .

Sensitivity is intuition .Sensitivity is compassion . Sensitivity is love .Sensitivity is real strength: calmness , endurance ,silence ,non-reactiveness ,confidence ,faith --and a smile.
Be both sensitive and strong.
