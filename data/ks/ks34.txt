THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOT IN THE UNIVERSE

 There is a place you can come where everything is beautiful. Tourists go from place to place looking for beauty. They try to take beauty from that place. They only get tired and tanned. Yet the most beautiful spot anywhere is right here. When you come here, you find that wherever you are, everything is so beautiful.

 Where is this place? Don't look here and there. Where do you go? Within you. When you come here, then any place is beautiful. Then wherever you go, you add beauty there.

 If you are unhappy, even the moon is irritating to you. Sweet things are nauseating, music is disturbing. When you are calm and centered inside, noise is musical, clouds are magical, rain is liquid sunshine.

 Book yourself on a trip to this most beautiful place in the universe. Then you find that every day is a vacation and a celebration.

 P.S. The answer to last weekÒ³ riddle is "advice." Advice hangs in the space, the giver goes on giving, the taker never takes. It goes on and on.

 

 And now the NEWS splash from the surf:

 A lady was driving along the coast of Kauai and just started singing our Bhajans which she had never heard before. Later she found herself at our Satsang.

 A Hawaiian Princess, Owana, found herself wondering why she felt compelled to drive in circles around a hotel in Honolulu. Later she found out from a devotee that it was Guruji's hotel. The next night she was singing her deeply felt native Hawaiian songs at Punditji's feet.

 On Sunday, a lady named Mary was spending the day at an ancient temple ruins. She had gone there to make an offering and to pray. Her prayer was to meet her spiritual teacher and be shown the way Home. On Monday, she met Punditji and instantly became devoted.

 Which one of your friends is next?

 

Jai Guru Dev
