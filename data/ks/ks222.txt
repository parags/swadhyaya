LIFE IS A WAR

Life is a war.
Doctors are fighting against diseases.
Lawyers fight against injustice.
Teachers are fighting against ignorance.

Depression happens when you lose the will to fight. Arjuna was depressed and he did not want to fight. His bow fell from his hands and his fingers trembled. Krishna urged him to wake up and fight! The decision to fight can take away your depression like it did for Arjuna.

Bharat says "Fight till you give up."

Prashant says "Not give up... give in!' (laughter)

Even your body is a battlefield.

 

NEWS FLASH

There were two glorious advanced courses and a fantastic TTC. The ashram was jam packed and more than 2000 happy faces lit up the ashram. Two Shankaracharyas met Guruji. Swami Swatantranandji regaled us with lots of stories from the Puranas. The Ashram is getting ready for the Navrathri celebrations which will start early next week.

 

Jai Guru Dev
