KARMA

 Strange are the ways of Karma. The more you understand it, the more amazed you become. It brings people together and separates them. It causes some to be weak and some to be strong. It makes some rich and some poor. All the struggle in the world, whatever it may be, is the bondage of Karma. It cuts across all logic and reasoning. This understanding will lift you from getting stuck to the events or personalities and help you in your Journey to the Self.

 Question: So a thief can say it is my karma to steal?

 Answer: Then the police have the karma to catch him too! (Laughter)

 Only human life has the ability to be free from Karma. And only a few thousands aim to be free from it. Only through Grace can the bondage of Karma be burnt. Performing actions cannot eliminate Karma.

 

 NEWS SPLASH:

 There was a surprise sunset in the swimming pool in Bali.

 We visited many temples on the ocean coast. The local people honored Guruji by taking him into an ancient Shiva temple which does not allow tourists.

 In Singapore, huge crowds welcomed Guruji. Scores of people had to be turned away from a Public Utility Auditorium. Many dignitaries including ministers and officials of Singapore and Malaysia were present. Among the others were Chinese musicians and Indian dancers. There were four wonderful Satsangs a day and delightfully delicious food everywhere. Many courses, including those in the corporate sector, are in progress. The highlight of the tour was an unexpected awakening talk on the Upanishads that left everyone spellbound and speechless.

 After a lightening Satsang in Madras, Guruji is back in the Ashram for a series of celebrations.

 

Jai Guru Dev
