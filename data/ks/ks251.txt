DESIRE FOR TRUTH

Buddha said that desire is the cause of all misery. If your desire does not get fulfilled, it leads to frustration and causes misery. Even if it does get fulfilled, it leaves you empty.

Vasishta said that desire is the cause of pleasure. You get pleasure from an object or a person only when you desire them. When you do not desire an object, you do not get pleasure from it. For example, when a person is hot and thirsty, a sip of cold water gives him pleasure; but not if he is not thirsty. Whatever gives you pleasure binds you and bondage is misery.

Sri Sri says when you desire for truth, all other desires drop off. You always desire for something that is not there. But, truth is always there! Desire for truth removes all other desires and it itself dissolves. And what remains is bliss.

NEWS FLASH

TTC I and TTC II ended on a celebrative note and with that began Guruji's South Asian tour. A well attended live Kriya, followed by a Satsang in a packed auditorium the next day highlighted the Singapore visit.

A lady reporter asked Guruji how many followers he has pointing to the people sitting in from of him; he replied, "I don't have any followers; they are all in front of me and I won't turn my back on anyone".

An Art of Living group presented the scientific research on mental health benefits of Sudarshan Kriya to the United Nation's Non-Governmental Organization Mental Health Committee. It was so well received that the discussion was extended an extra hour.

Jai Guru Dev
