IGNORANCE OF YOUR CAPABILITY CAN EXPAND YOU!

Always know that the Divine never gives you a responsibility you cannot fulfill.

Nobody ever expects you to treat them if you are not a doctor.

Nobody will ask you to fix their wiring system if you are not an electrician.

Your responsibility is only what you can do.

And you do not know what you can do!

Always accept that you do not know what you can do.

 

Ignorance of your capability can expand you!

 

When you know what you can do, you can progress.

But when you do not know what you can do, you can grow by leaps and bounds!

 

When you know what you can do, you can do things.

When you do not know what you can do, you can do things even better!

 

Jai Guru Dev

CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WITH GURUJI
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at the Canadian Ashram

  Jai Guru Dev !  We are very excited to announce that Guruji is coming to the Canadian Ashram over the Christmas Holidays, his first winter visit here. This is an especially beautiful, silent and cozy time of year at the ashram.  What a blessing to end the year and start the New Year in the presence of the Master.
