Glory (Vaibhav) and Dispassion (Vairag)

It is often believed that glory and dispassion are contradictory and cannot co-exist. Glory and luxury without dispassion is a nauseating pomp and show. Such glory does not bring fulfillment for anyone… it is shallow. Alternately, the dispassion that is afraid of glory is weak. True dispassion is oblivious to glory.

The glory that comes with dispassion is something that is true, that is permanent and authentic. When someone runs after glory they are shallow. Like movie stars, politicians and religious leaders who try to hold on to their status, to their glory, they are certain to lose. If you run after glory all you get is misery. When you are dispassionate, glory comes to you.

If you are afraid of glory, that means you are not well-founded in dispassion. In India, the Sadhus run away from glory. They think they will lose their dispassion and get trapped in the web of the world, the circus. The dispassion is so blissful, they get attached to the dispassion. (laughter)

They are afraid of losing the dispassion, the centeredness and bliss that comes along with it. This is weak dispassion. Dispassion is a state of being and glory is the happening around it. True dispassion can never be lost or overshadowed by glory.

True dispassion is glorious!

Real glory is true dispassion!

News Flash:

Colorado Springs and Boulder witnessed overflowing halls of joy for Guruji’s public talks. The students and faculty of Naropa University were ecstatic and inspired finding Guruji in their midst.

Sri Sri visited the Garden of the Gods, a sacred site for Native Americans with towering red rock formations. Although the rocks were glorious all eyes were on Guruji! For wherever Guruji goes on this planet, glory follows.
