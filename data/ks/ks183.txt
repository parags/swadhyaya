ORGANIZATION

The entire creation is a huge organization. Everything is made up of atoms. The whole world is nothing but organization, where the atoms have decided to organize themselves in a specific pattern to form a particular substance. And those particular patterns bring them specific qualities.

Death/decay/transformation happens when the atoms get bored of patterns and decide to recognise themselves.

e.g. : When the atoms of the apple say "Enough of being an apple", that's when the rotting starts. If there is never boredom of patterns, there can be no decay.

The movement from one organized state to another is also organized. This is the transient organization which we call chaos. This transient organization may need a catalyst. Knowledge is such a catalyst.

So, you have absolutely no escape from organisation.
