DIVINE LOVE AND THE COMPLAINING FACE

How would you like to see yourself happy and bubbling with enthusiasm or dull and difficult to please?

Often you like to be pleased, appeased and cajoled. So you put up a tough, upset face and act difficult to please. If a person has to appease and please ten people all the time, it will be so tiring. People who keep a long face and expect others to cajole and appease them make others run away. Lovers often do this. They expend a lot of energy in cajoling and this brings down the joy and celebration of the moment.

It is okay for you to show your upset mood or tendency once in a while, but doing it over and over again is taxing for you and people you love.

If you feel down, appease and please yourself. Your need to be appeased by someone else is the sign of grossness. This is the root of ignorance. If you want attention, all you get is tension.

Become one whose enthusiasm never dies, come what may.

It is not possible to attain Divine Love with a complaining face. The complaining face is a sign of an unaware mind. If you want to complain, complain to God or your Guru because both have their ears covered. (Laughter)

NEWS FLASH From a village near Alwar in Rajasthan, a nine year old girl, Uma, who was dumb from birth started speaking after her ART Excel Course. The same was reported of a twelve year old boy from Vallabh Vidyanagar in Gujarat.

Talakatora Stadium in Delhi was aptly decorated for a grand Satsang. Thousands who could not enter the stadium could still fully participate thanks to the big screens provided by the organizers. Guruji went to Rishikesh to inspire and to get inspired by the 108 youth leaders who were going to take up the 5H Program.

Jai Guru Dev
