NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATION

 New Year's was a grand celebration . . . like everyday!

And everyone was unusually crazy . . . like everyday!

Guruji was fantastically charming . . . like everyday!

And a basket full of chocolates was on the couch . . . like everyday!

They were in shape of bees today.

And they started flying from the Guru's hand.

JUST BE

 Joy is dissolving . . . losing your identity.

Rest is dissolving . . . losing your identity.

Love is dissolving . . . losing your identity.

The message for 1996 is . . . JUST BE!

Relax and just be.

That doesn't mean be lazy . . . No!

Be very busy . . . and just be.

The events come and go, they perish like flowers.

But every event and every person contains some honey.

Like a bee, just take the honey out of every event and every moment and move on.

 Be like a busy bee and be in the Being.

 Question: What is the nectar of life?

Answer: The Infinity . . . The Divinity.

 How do you like it . . . huh?

 

Jai Guru Dev
