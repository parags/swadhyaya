Drop Your Intentions

A strong tendency to keep doing something, whether important or unimportant, becomes an impediment to meditation. Doing starts first with an intention and then translates into action. Though intention springs from the Being, when it becomes doing it doesn’t let you settle down. All intentions, good or bad, trivial or important, need to be dropped for meditation to happen.

Vijay: But isn’t dropping all intentions itself an intention?

Sri Sri: Yes, but that intention is the last and necessary intention. Dropping the intentions is not an act – just the intention to drop the intentions itself serves the purpose. Dropping all intentions even for a moment brings you in touch with your Self – that instant meditation happens.

While you sit for meditation you have to let the world be the way it is. The repetition of meditation is to habituate our system to be able to stop and start activity at will. The ability to do this consciously is a very precious skill.

New Flash:

Navaratri saw unmitigated joy with devotees from all over the world. Guruji emerged from silence more even radiant, more profound. Many saints visited the ashram during the Poojas. A renowned saint from Rishikesh gave discourses on the Bhagvatam daily. Yagyas were performed for the health, happiness and well being of people all over the world, which would also contribute to establishing peace everywhere.

Blessings are always special, but the ecstasy experienced by one and all on Rishi Homa (the last day of Navaratri) as Guruji enthusiastically rushed into the crowds, spraying all His devotees with the Holy waters, was without parallel!
