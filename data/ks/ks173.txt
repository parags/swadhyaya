YAGNA

Yagna creates energy, energy creates consciousness, awareness. Heightened awareness brings you close to the reality and the reality is a witness.

To realize that everything is happening you need heightened awareness. And to bring about heightened awareness you have to increase the prana.

Prana can be increased through:

Fasting, fresh food
Pranayamas, Kriya, meditation
Silence
Cold water baths
Total exhaustion, not letting sleep take over
Emotional peaks
Presence of the Master
Singing and chanting
Giving without a givership, service without a doership
All of these together is Yagna.
