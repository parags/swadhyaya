TENDENCIES AND INFLUENCES

 

Life moves by dual (two) factors: inner tendencies and outer influences.

Inner tendencies form your attitudes and behavior, while external influences makes strong impressions in your mind. Often your tendencies generate external situations. And situations around you can form tendencies within you. This is what is called Karma. Both these factors - the tendencies from within and influences from outside, can either be beneficial or harmful.

It is the awareness that filters the outer negative influences and it is the awareness that corrects and annihilates the unhealthy inner tendencies. This awareness is called Gyana. The purpose of education is to develop this awareness, so that you can be selective about your tendencies and influences.

It is practically impossible to resist the external influences and the inner tendencies without raising oneâ€™s consciousness. This can be gradual or sudden. And that is how a human being has both free will and destiny.

Freedom is when you have a say about your tendencies and your influences. And only awareness and impeccable devotion can bring this freedom.

 

Guruji's address to the Protestant Christian Congregation in Germany was simply brilliant. Denmark, Sweden and Norway had enthralling Satsangs. He is moving on to the Advanced Course in Gotenborg.
