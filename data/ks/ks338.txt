Don't Be Perturbed by Foolishness

What really perturbs you? Isnâ€™t it the foolishness that goes on around you?

It is foolish to be perturbed by the foolishness. Foolishness cannot overpower or annihilate wisdom nor does the foolishness stay all the time. When you are not well-founded in wisdom, then foolishness perturbs you, throws you out of balance. When you create space for foolishness you do not get perturbed by it, rather you will laugh and move on. Otherwise you hate, get angry or become stressed by foolish acts.

When you know that truth is eternal and invincible you take foolishness as a joke and remain unmoved by it. Those who are averse to foolishness or get irritated by it are members of the fools club.

Beware! Do not sign up.
