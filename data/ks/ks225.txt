ALWAYS?

How to be happy always?
Forget about always, then you are happy.

      In wanting to be comfortable always, one becomes lazy.
      In wanting perfection always, one become angry.
      In wanting to be rich always, one becomes greedy
When we do not realise that only life is for always, then fear comes.

This projection of the nature of self which is "always", on the temporal which can never be "always", is called Maya.

All ways do not lead you, only one way leads you.
If you remove always from your dictionary then everything is alright
Drop "always" and all will be right - that is intelligence.

NEWS FLASH

Guruji was the chief guest at a Muslim gathering where He spoke on "Human Values and Prophet Mohammed".

Guruji initiated a revolutionary move amongst 24 prominent saints of India to welcome His Holiness Pope John Paul II to India which was publicised in several National newspapers.

In the week that passed, Guruji said that it was a "free" week, with not much appointments but He ended up being busier than when He was supposed to be "busy"!!!!

 

Jai Guru Dev
