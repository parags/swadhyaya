SINCERITY AND BLESSINGS

Q: Many ask for blessings but only a few will receive it. Why?

A: The giver is anyway giving but the taker is not there - the sincerity is missing. One who gives blessings gives it freely but the one who receives it has to be sincere. Sincerity is the qualification to receive blessings. And everyone is free to be sincere at any point of time or space.

Q: Why do people choose to be sincere only sometimes?

A: Because of the illusion that they are going to miss some mundane pleasure. Hankering after pleasure makes them insincere. When you are sincere you simply enjoy pleasure.

Poor people fight for food. Rich people share their food. Richer are those people who share power. Richer still are those who share fame. Richest are those who share themselves. Richness of a person is indicated by his ability to share and not by what he hoards. Godliness is enjoying sharing fame.

"Sincerity is being in touch with your Depth."

NEWS FLASH

The silence became alive with Vedic chantings. The saffron clad Swamis on either side of Guru Dev added luster to the gathering. The whole Ashram was so vibrant with Divine energy that the renowned pundits who had performed so many Yagyas felt the difference. As the Pundits became busier, the devotees became serene and still. The silence was thick and profound and the celebration was loud and colorful. And with each passing day Guru Dev grew younger and more radiant. Those who walked near Guru Dev's Kutir would experience different fragrances which kept changing every few minutes!

Jai Guru Dev
