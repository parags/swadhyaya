THINK FRESH

To think fresh you need to be free of all the impressions. Let go of all the impressions right this moment and be Hollow and Empty. When you hear a word the sound conveys the meaning instantaneously. Similarly, the knowledge that you are sitting, standing, talking, etc. neither needs a confirmation nor a proof.

Just an intention to be free makes you free right away. Realization that freedom is your very nature, brings enormous Shakti (Energy).

FORGET ABOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE FAX AND BE FRESH!!! (laughter)

NEWS FLASH

Mumbai media had big coverage about GurujiÒ³ visit there. The football stadium of Cooperage saw over 50,000 people spellbound in meditation and Satsang. Everyone was welcomed with sandalwood paste and sweets. Guruji visited blind women in a shelter named after HIM.

Then on to Cochin in Kerala where an inter-faith convention attended by thousands. The Imam of Trivandrum and the Bishop of Cochin have praised the Art of Living in elevating Human Values. Several senior government officials and dignitaries took part in the program.

A traffic policeman in Cochin suddenly got a glimpse of Guruji and started giving wrong signals ("with a blissful smile on his face", Raghu adds). In the evening, Guruji served dinner for all the volunteers before leaving Kottayam. Even though there is a political strike throughout Kerala, only Art of Living vehicles are plying smoothly on the roads and only Art of Living satsangs are held as scheduled.

 

Jai Guru Dev
