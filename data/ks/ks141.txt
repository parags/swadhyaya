Respect

When someone respects you, it is not because you possess some virtues, it is because of their generosity, their greatness. If you say God is great, it makes YOU great. God is anyway already great, you saying so doesn't affect God.

When you respect someone, it only shows your own magnanimity. How many people you don't respect in the world, that much less is your wealth. If you respect everyone in the world, that much more is your value. Wiser is the one who respects everyone.

Question : But Gurudev, you can't respect a terrorist!

Sri Sri : You have to respect a terrorist too because he shows you the way at his own cost.

Respectfulness is a quality of refined consciousness. Respect for the Self is faith. Faith is being open.

If you are open, you are close.

If you are close, you cannot but open up.
