HOW TO DEAL WITH ANXIETY

Today many are anxious about how to deal with their anxiety!

Here are some of the ways you can manage your anxiety:

1. Sing, dance and celebrate. The very intention to celebrate will pull you away from anxiety to a more harmonious state.

2. Think about what you can do for others rather than just about yourself. Energize yourself with some service activity.

3. Combined practice of yoga, breathing and meditation.

4. Know the impermanence of the world.

5. Having faith and surrendering to the Divine and knowing that there is a supreme power who loves you. The supreme power is behind you and accepts you totally. The sense of security comes with the sense of belongingness.

6. Valour/courage: Invoking the lion within you and having an attitude of sacrifice will rescue you from anxiety.

7. Reminding yourself that you are committed to a greater goal will keep the anxiety away.

8. Being unpredictable for a while. Anxiety is always related to some anticipated action. Do something completely irrelevant and unpredictable.

9. Readiness to face the worst will leave you with stability in the mind.

10. Remembering a similar situation in the past when you were able to overcome your anxiety.

Chanakya : If none of theses work just come and be in the presence of the Master. (laughter)
