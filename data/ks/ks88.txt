BE LOVED

You don't need to worry to maintain knowledge. When knowledge is lodged in you as wisdom, it will never leave you. Wisdom lodges itself in your heart. Make the Divine your Valentine (your sweet Beloved). This is the last thing to do and the first thing to do. Keep your heart in a safe place; it is too delicate. Events, small things make strong impressions on it. And you cannot find a better place than the Divine to keep your heart safe and your mind sane. When you keep your heart in the Divine, the moving time, the passing events, will not be able to touch it, will not create a scar. A precious stone needs a setting around it, gold or silver, to hold it and to wear it; so wisdom and knowledge are that setting around the heart which will hold it in the Divine.

See the Divine in your Valentine and make the Divinity your Valentine (your sweet beloved). Just BE. . .and know that you are LOVED... That is BELOVED.

NEWS FLASH

From Los Angeles Guruji and the entourage went to New Jersey, New York, Phiadelphia and Houston for Satsangs and packed lectures. Credit goes to ALL the organizers. Then it was on to Fort Lauderdale where the knowledge faxes are pouring in from all corners and each of them is simply astounding. Bill and Anne will bring out another Knowledge sheet collection book very soon. The dynamic group of Florida did just a little bit to put together a beautiful course.

P.S. How many of you work hard? Wai till next week for the answer.
