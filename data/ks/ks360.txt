NIGRA, AGRA, SATYAGRA AND DURAGRA

Nigra means control.

Agra means insistence.

Satyagra means steadfast determination.

Duragra means blind adamancy, reckless stubbornness.

These four will give you progress when practiced for a limited period of time. They give limited results, positive or negative. But if they stay on for a longer period, they eat away the potential of life. One has to transcend all these four to attain peace.

Freedom is when you transcend all four. They are inevitable to streamline life but you need to transcend them to be free.

Give your own examples and discuss nigra, agra, satyagra, and duragra.
