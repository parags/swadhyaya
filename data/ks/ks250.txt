YOU ARE NOTHING!

Each experience completes. Completion means leading to void or nothing. In the progression of life, you will leave behind every experience saying, "This is nothing." Anything that is completed loses its importance. That is to say it leads you to void - this is nothing.

A sign of intelligence is how soon you arrive at this understanding. Examine everything in life and say "This is nothing" and what remains after all that is Love, and that is everything.

When "This is nothing" does not come out of knowledge, it comes out of misery. Either through knowledge or through misery, you come to the point of "This is nothing, this is nothing". The choice is yours.

If you got this, it is really NOTHING, If you didn't get this, never mind - this is nothing. (laughter)

News Flash:

Guruji addressed the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) Annual meeting in New Delhi, and was well received.

Guruji visited Ulaan Bataar, capital of Mongolia, on a two-day state visit and was received by the first President of the Mongolian Republic and a few members of parliament. Though the flight was delayed by five hours, thousands waited at the National Opera House, where Guruji was driven straight from the airport. Even though he had traveled such a long distance, there was not a trace of tiredness as he greeted the cheering crowd. Guruji tricked the security guards several times and mingled with the crowd.

Meetings and satsangs at Ulaan Bataar were filled with gratitude. A 10 year old boy who was deaf for several years regained his hearing! A lady who had suffered a paralytic attack felt sensations all through her body on seeing Guruji's picture in the newspapers. Three days later, with some help she came walking to attend Guruji's satsang!!!

On April 29th, Guruji was received by Mongolia's highest Buddhist leader, His Holiness The Hamba Lama Choijamts at the Gandan monastery. The Lama, in his welcome address, noted that Guruji's work has brought so much peace and strength to the people of Mongolia.

Jai Guru Dev

SPEICAL NOTE:

May 13 is Guruji's Birthday. Be sure to keep him in your heart throughout the day and especially when you meditate.

In past years we have meditated at the time of dawn in India on May 13 to celebrate and welcome this special day.

Think of how he has opened your heart and see if you can help to do the same for those around you on this day.
