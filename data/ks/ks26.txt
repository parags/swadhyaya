ALL ARE SEARCHING FOR SWEETS,

THE ONE WHO FINDS THEM,

GIVES THEM AWAY

 

Guruji was on the porch with a group of people. He sent Kashi to get the sweets from inside the kuti, but Kashi returned saying he could not find them. He went again and again, three times, and still he could not find them. Then Guruji himself went in. He came out with the sweets and gave them to everyone.

 This is exactly what happens in life. Many want sweetness in life. Some are searching hard, but only one finds it. And when that one finds it, he gives it to everyone.

 Everyone is blissed in and some are blissed out, too!

 

Jai Guru Dev
