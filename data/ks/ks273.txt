PERFECTION IS THE NATURE OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONE

In a state of ignorance, imperfection is natural and perfection is an effort.

In a state of wisdom or enlightenment, imperfection is an effort; perfection is a compulsion and is unavoidable!

Perfection is taking total responsibility, and total responsibility means knowing that you are the only responsible person in the whole world. When you think that others are responsible, then your degree of responsibility diminishes.

When you are in total Vairagya (dispassion), you can take care of even trivial and insignificant things with such perfection. For example, during the Pooja every morning, Guruji decorates the Pooja table with flowers with such great care, choosing different color combinations and patterns everyday; fully knowing that the decoration is not going to last even 10 minutes. After the Pooja He himself would remove the garlands from the Pooja table or shower people with the flowers on it. Yet even while He is in a deep state of Samadhi, He would effortlessly and lovingly decorate the Pooja table everyday. It is obvious that it does not matter how the flowers are kept, but still attention to even such a trivial thing with such keenness of awareness can only come through utter dispassion.

Perfection is the very nature of the Enlightened one.
