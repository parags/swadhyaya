INFINITE PATIENCE AND SMART SHOPPING

Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.

When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience. When you have infinite patience, you will realize God belongs to you. Either through awareness or through practice you reach the same spot.

Question: What do you mean by "owning God?"

Answer: The Divinity belongs to you. It's not like shopping at the supermarket in a hurry and rushing back home. When you see the whole store is at home, you are not in a hurry to shop. You are at ease.

Question: To develop patience do we just observe the impatience?

Answer: Just observe the thoughts and feelings and don't regret about it.

When you know you are part of the divine plan, you stop demanding. Then you know everything is being done for you. You are taken care of. Usually we do it the other way: we hurry the mind and are slow in our action. Impatience means hurry in the mind; lethargy means slowness in action. Patience in the mind and dynamism in action is the right formula.

It was a big week. Newspapers published articles, television ran interviews, and hundreds came to attend intro and advanced courses. Teachers from all over North America are being revised and revived.

No one was concerned about the Blackout of( รยน6XXXXX), which affected six states between Canada and Mexico, because Guruji promised the lights would come on before the talk. And they did!

For people who do not have a teacher in their area and/or have not taken the Intro Course, Guruji is structuring an evening of chanting and knowledge. More on this soon.

Jai Guru Dev
