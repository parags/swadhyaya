DO YOU TEST GOD, OR DOES GOD TEST YOU?

Testing is part of ignorance. You only test that of which you are not sure. If God is testing you, that means God doesn'tÂ´ know you well enough. How could people ever think that God is testing them?

God does not test you because he knows you in and out and your past, present and future. He knows your strengths and weaknesses and he alone gives you strength. He doesn't test you.

Only you can test yourself. Only when you do not have confidence, then you test. If you are confident, why would you test? If you are testing yourself, you do not know yourself.

Are you testing God?

God will never pass your test because He will never show up for your test. If He shows up for your test, then He is not God (laughter).

Whether you get this or not - just laugh!

Guruji's tour of the Netherlands began with a noontime talk at the University of Maastricht to an overcrowded hall with no room to even stand. The group continued to Amsterdam, where he gave a great talk on Human Values to 140 diplomats, ministers and ambassadors representing 20 countries. The next evening, a public talk was held in a beautifully decorated hall with melodious music and marvelous meditation and everyone was in bliss. There was an art exhibit on Human Values and the atmosphere was filled with joy and enthusiasm.
