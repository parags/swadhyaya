Your Nature is Shiva

Peace is your nature, yet you remain restless.
Freedom is your nature, yet you remain in bondage.
Happiness is your nature, yet you become miserable for some reason or another.
Contentment is your nature, yet you continue to reel in desires.
Benevolence is your nature, yet you donâ€™t reach out.
Going towards your nature is Sadhana.
Sadhana is becoming what you truly Are!

Your true nature is Shiva.
And Shiva is peace, infinity, beauty and the non-dual One.
Ratri means "to take refuge." Shivaratri is taking refuge in Shiva.

News Flash:

Guruji was a state guest in Uttaranchal and was welcomed by the Chief Minister. Mr. and Mrs. Mann hosted a beautiful satsang in Dehradun.

Shivaratri celebrations in Rishikesh truly took us to the peak of bliss and to silence beyond. Rudra poojas in the morning and evening cast a spell in the air, the chants reverberated through the ashram and stilled the hearts and minds. The all-night satsang saw thousands, and concluded with an early morning Sudarshan Kriya with the Master.

Jai Guru Dev !
