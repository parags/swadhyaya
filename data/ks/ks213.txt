GURU IS THE GOAL

Guru is nothing but wisdom and love.

Guru is that principle which is wisdom and love, and that is awakened in each one who has stepped onto the path. You also call that person a Guru in whom there is no gap between life and wisdom and love.

Often one recognizes wisdom but sees a gap between wisdom and one's own life. The purpose of becoming a disciple is to bridge that gap. Being with the Guru means spontaneous integration of life and wisdom.
