THE ARROW OF FAITH

It is only through merit that you can have faith. When you lack faith, happiness is neither in the inner nor the outer world. Happiness springs forth from faith. Happiness is forgetting the body consciousness. Pain or sorrow is holding on to the body consciousness. Whenever you are happy you don't feel the body and when you are miserable, you have aches and pains.

Question: Then why in meditation is the attention taken to various parts of the body?

Guruji: For an arrow to go forward, you have to pull it back. In the same way when you take the attention to the various parts of the body, it frees you from body consciousness.

 

NEWS FLASH

Guruji's first whirlwind tour in the Punjab was exhilarating.

Joginder Sing, an 86 year old man, was color blind for the last 10 years and he regained his sense of colors. The world which was black and white once again became a color movie.

Mr. Sunif Gulati, the Director of the Government Dept of Health, had lost mobility of his neck due to an accident in 1984. Guruji casually put his hand on his neck and the next day, to his surprise, he gained back total mobility!

Another man, who had varicose veins and had an appointment for surgery, disappointed the surgeon because it was healed on the fourth day of the course.

During the Whole Life fair, Nityanand found a new style of introducing people to the course. Two gentlemen who came to our stall in the Whole Life fair asked of Nityanand, "What is this?"

Nityanand replied in rhythm, "Neither I know nor you, just sign up!"

The gentlemen, who were tired of listening to the lengthy explanations from all the other stalls, jumped up and said, "Wow! This is the real thing!". They signed up for the course!

 

Jai Guru Dev
